# setup-harnesses.sh — project the canonical `skills/` tree into every agent
# harness this repository supports.
#
# `skills/` at the repository root is the single source of truth. Each harness
# reads skills from its own convention directory, so this script links the
# canonical tree into each one. The links are relative and idempotent: re-running
# converges to the same layout without duplicating or nesting anything, and the
# checkout stays relocatable (an absolute link would keep pointing at wherever
# the checkout happened to live when the script last ran).
#
# Harnesses:
#   .claude/skills       Claude Code
#   .pi/skills           Pi
#   .opencode/skills     OpenCode
#   .antigravity/skills  Google Antigravity
#
# Usage:
#   npm run setup:harnesses
#   bash scripts/setup-harnesses.sh

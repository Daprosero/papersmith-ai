"""figure_dimensions: the visual-dimension roster and its reason-code
vocabulary, declared exactly once so the producer (`figure-review`) and
the consumer (`paper-writing`'s `audit_semantics` default) cannot drift
apart (design.md, Decision 4: "The dimension roster and reason-code
vocabulary are declared once, in a shared `.opencode/skills/_core/figure/` shelf
both sides import").

Zero imports, by construction and by test: this module's AST is checked
for zero `Import`/`ImportFrom` nodes (design.md lock 12), which is what
makes the forge gate's `IMPORT_SCOPE_PATHSPECS` scan (scoped to
`.opencode/skills/*/scripts/*.py`, and therefore blind to
`.opencode/skills/_core/figure/`)
unnecessary rather than merely absent -- a module that cannot import
anything needs no import scan. That is also why this file carries no
`from __future__ import annotations`: that statement is itself an
`ImportFrom` node.

Three tiers (`visual-finding-boundary` spec, `Requirement: Every Visual
Dimension Is Classified Into Exactly One Tier`):

    VERDICT_DIMENSIONS  -- a computed pass/fail, naming an edge or a
                            collision when it fails.
    EVIDENCE_DIMENSIONS -- a number worth reporting, carrying no verdict.
    SILENT_DIMENSIONS   -- an announced silence: unmeasured, with a
                            named reason, because the thing it would
                            answer is a judgement, not a pixel property.

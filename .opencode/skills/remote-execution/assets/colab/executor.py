"""The Colab VM-side executor — everything after `launch.py` spawned it.

Runs INSIDE the session's working directory (`/content/.psmith/<session>`
in production; its own resolved directory everywhere else, which is what
lets the forge suite execute it without a VM). It reads the uploaded
`run-config.json` and `runner.ipynb`, executes the notebook with
`nbclient`, and writes the three files the session protocol is built on:

- `runner.executed.ipynb` — the executed notebook, written on the failure
  path too, because a notebook that died halfway is the only record of
  where it died (`runner_invoke.py`'s own doctrine, applied one level up);
- `files.json` — the manifest `fetch()` downloads: the runner's
  working-directory capture (every regular file under this directory,
  minus the protocol's own names and minus `clone/.git`). Never a
  candidate scan, and never the pinned clone's VCS metadata: this is the
  landed capture rule of the parent plan's D12 (judged fix S2-J1, with
  the `.git` fold-in S2-J12);
- `status.json` — LAST, and outside every other try/finally: its presence
  is the run's only completion signal (`exitCode` 0 or non-zero, never
  absent for a run that reached this process).

A crash before `status.json` leaves the run `running` to a poll, which is
exactly what it is: the evidence that completion happened is missing, not
negative, so nothing here ever invents one early.

Nothing here names the service, reads a credential, or knows the CLI
exists: this file's whole world is one directory on one VM. The S3
credential material lives in this same boundary and nowhere else: a
staged `git-askpass.sh` is made executable here (chmod 0o700 — the upload
is a measured byte-copy and asserts no mode), both it and its token file
are deleted best-effort after the execution attempt, BEFORE the manifest
walk, and both names are excluded from the manifest at the top level as
the fallback that covers a failed deletion or a notebook that never
started.

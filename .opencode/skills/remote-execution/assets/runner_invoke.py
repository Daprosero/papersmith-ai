"""Cell 1 of the generated runner notebook — copied byte for byte.

Runs whichever of the two shapes the selected block declares.

- A CALLABLE block (`module` / `function` / `kwargs`) resolves through
  `importlib` and is called.
- A NOTEBOOK block (`notebook`) is read out of the clone, executed in a
  kernel with the clone's `src` on its `PYTHONPATH`, and written back
  executed into the runner's own working directory, which is what makes
  its outputs part of what a fetch returns.

Both stay reachable, deliberately. The notebook shape exists so that what
a worker runs can be the notebook a pilot validated, rather than a second
implementation of it whose agreement nothing checks. The callable shape
stays because a worker asked to settle one question is legitimately a
function call, and some entries cannot be named by a `module`/`function`
contract at all. `block_kind()` decides between them and refuses a block
that declares neither or both — never a default, because on this side of
the wire every default costs the same quota as the right answer.

The `smoke` variant is selected the same way for both shapes, when
`run_config["mode"] == "smoke"`. Cell 0
(`runner_bootstrap.py`) has already sparse-cloned the pinned commit and
put its `src/` on `sys.path` before this cell ever runs — `SystemExit`
there means this cell never runs at all — so the module named here
resolves from that same clone, never from anywhere this cell reaches on
its own initiative.

Importable and independently testable the same way `runner_bootstrap.py`
is: nothing runs at import time, and the orchestrating call sits behind
`if __name__ == "__main__":`, letting the forge suite drive
`select_block()`, `resolve_callable()` and `invoke()` directly against
fake `run-config.json` payloads.

No service name occurs anywhere in this file, and none may be added
later either.

    left in its working directory, which is already how `bootstrap.json`
    returns, so an executed notebook written there needs nothing added
    anywhere else in this skill to arrive.

    The kernel is started with `kernel_environment()`'s variables: the
    clone's `src` first on `PYTHONPATH`, the clone's directory and the
    pinned commit under the two forge-owned names the notebook's own first
    cell reads, and — when this submission declares either —
    `FORGE_RUN_MODE`/`FORGE_RUN_UNITS` under the two names

    `run-config.json` by way of `invoke()`, and `commit` is the only thing

    notebook's own cells are the pinned bytes cell 0 fetched, identical for
    every worker that runs the same clone, so a per-submission fact has
    nowhere to live but the environment its kernel starts in.

    Four things this refuses rather than works around:

    - a run with no commit to hand over. This is the metered path; a
      notebook started without the pin is a notebook that has to work the
      repository out for itself, and the answer it works out is a
      directory that exists on any worker. Refused BEFORE the kernel
      starts, because a job that runs the wrong commit works;
    - a notebook path that escapes the clone, or is not a file inside it
      (cell 0 already proves this for a declared notebook, and this cell
      proves it again because it is the cell that opens the file);
    - a missing `nbformat`/`nbclient` — an `ImportError` becomes an
      `InvokeError` naming `environment.install` as the remedy, the same
      remedy cell 0's own executor gate names;
    - an execution that raises — the partially-executed notebook is
      written to the same destination BEFORE the failure is re-raised, so
      the fetched artifact carries the traceback in the cell that
      produced it instead of nothing at all.

    A callable block resolves through `importlib` and is called with its

    executed from the clone and written back executed. `block_kind()`
    decides, and it refuses a block that is neither or both — this
    function has no default branch, because the only default available
    costs the same quota as the right answer.

    `run_config["commit"]`, `run_config["mode"]` and `run_config["units"]`
    are all read here and handed down rather than looked up again lower:
    this is where the config is, and re-reading any of the three somewhere
    else would be a second place that decides which commit, which mode, or
    which units a submission runs against. Read with `.get()` and never
    `[...]` — a missing pin becomes `execute_notebook()`'s own refusal,
    which says what could not be handed over, instead of a `KeyError` that
    says only that a dictionary was missing a key; a missing mode or units
    is simply absent, and `submission_environment()` is what turns that
    absence into no environment variable at all rather than a refusal,
    because unlike the pin, neither one is required for either shape to
    run.

    The notebook branch hands `mode`/`units` down through
    `execute_notebook()`'s own parameters, which compose them into the
    kernel's environment the same way `commit` already is. The CALLABLE
    branch has no kernel and no `execute_notebook()` to hand them through,
    so it composes `submission_environment()` directly and applies it to
    `os.environ` around the call, restoring it afterward with the exact
    idiom `execute_notebook()` already uses for its own handoff — save
    whatever each variable held before, update, run, then put every saved
    value back (or remove the variable if there was nothing to restore).
    The reason the callable branch needs this at all: `block["kwargs"]` is
    written once, at job generation, and is therefore IDENTICAL for every
    worker a job fans out to, while `mode` and `units` are written once per
    SUBMISSION by the packer and the CLI (`remote_cli.py:1260-1261`). A
    callable that needs to know which units it was handed, or whether it
    is running the smoke variant, cannot learn either from `kwargs` no
    matter how the job was generated — the environment is the only channel
    either shape has for a fact that varies per submission rather than per
    job.

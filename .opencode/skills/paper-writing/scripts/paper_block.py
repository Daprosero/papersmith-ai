"""paper_block: marker grammar, locate, substitute, invariant.

Delimits, locates, replaces and refuses over named blocks inside a
`main.tex`-shaped file, byte-for-byte. Block ids are opaque here — shape
only (`[A-Za-z0-9._-]+`), no semantics; their grammar and ordering belong to
a sibling change. All I/O is binary end to end: universal-newlines text mode
would rewrite every CRLF in the file and break the byte-identity invariant
silently, which is exactly the failure this module exists to prevent.

Public surface, disk-touching functions first (the ones `paper_cli.py` wires
directly):

    read_status(paper_dir)   -> dict              (resolves main.tex, hands
                                                     its bytes to status())
    open_block(paper_dir, block_id, ...) -> dict   (impure; end to end)
    substitute(paper_dir, block_id, ...) -> dict   (impure; end to end)

And the pure engine underneath, reusable without touching disk:

    parse(data)              -> ParsedDocument   (raises TEX_UNDECODABLE,

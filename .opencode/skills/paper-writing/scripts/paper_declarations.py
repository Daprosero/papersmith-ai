"""paper_declarations: the `declarations` region — operator-supplied
declarations and fact resolutions, collected progressively, fixed once
recorded, reopened only by name.

Two record kinds, `declaration` (six operator-input ids, field `value`) and
`fact` (ten fact ids, field `resolution`) — deliberately different field
names, so the two vocabularies can never share a code path by accident
(design.md, `JSON region bodies, comment-prefixed, canonically serialized`:
"a shared field name invites a shared code path, and a shared code path is
exactly how a closed vocabulary gets opened by accident").

Neither `NOT_A_DECLARATION` nor `NOT_A_FACT` exists as a code of its own:
`paper_vocabulary.validate_declaration` / `validate_fact` are called
directly, so the SAME `UNKNOWN_DECLARATION` / `UNKNOWN_FACT` codes Phase 2
already raises for a header value fire here too (design.md, `Refusal codes
and their classification`: "two codes for one condition is the drift this
repository's roster exists to prevent").

    Refuses `UNKNOWN_FACT` when `fact_id` is not one of the ten declared

    Refuses `DECLARATION_FIXED` when the fact is already resolved OR already

    Refuses `DECLINE_REASON_REQUIRED` (new; INVOCATION_DEFECT) when `reason`

    to remove. Enforced here, in the module itself, not only at the CLI
    layer, so any caller — not just `declare --decline` — is held to it.

    `condition` is MANDATORY and is what makes a decline expire rather than
    stand forever on a human's memory. It is a JSON object of the shape
    `paper_vocabulary.CONDITION_TYPES` closes over, stored verbatim in the

    (whether the condition currently holds is a `read_declined`/readiness
    concern, not a decline-time gate: you can decline for a condition that
    happens to already be false, and the very next `readiness`/`phases`
    call will correctly report it `stale` rather than `declined`).

    Refuses `CONDITION_REQUIRED` (invocation-defect) when `condition` is
    `None`. Refuses `CONDITION_MALFORMED` (work-state — same classification
    family as this skill's other MALFORMED_* codes) when it is not a JSON
    object, is missing a type-required field, or names a `path` that
    resolves outside `paper_dir`'s own parent directory. Refuses
    `UNKNOWN_CONDITION_TYPE` (work-state) when `condition["type"]` is
    outside the closed vocabulary.

    `produced_by` (`a-fact-is-declared-or-it-is-produced`, tasks.md Unit 3,
    3.2): the same producer tuple `set_fact` accepts, checked FIRST — a
    produced fact can never be declined either, regardless of whether
    `reason`/`condition` would otherwise be valid (`_refuse_if_produced`).
    Defaults to `()`, unaffecting every existing caller.

    No new `forge_root` parameter anywhere — `condition["path"]` is
    resolved relative to `paper_dir.parent`, which is the repository root
    under this skill's own default layout (`<repo>/paper`) and under every
    existing test fixture's own convention (`self.paper_dir = self.forge_root

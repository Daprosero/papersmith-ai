"""paper_grounding: per-sentence support reconciliation for a transposition
block against its own bound source section's bytes (`transposition-
grounding` spec; `design.md`, "The block asserts only what its section
carries").

A fourth sibling in `write_block`'s judge chain, shaped on `paper_audit.py`'s
own account-versus-real-bytes reconciliation (`:56-101`), never extending it
(design.md D5). An agent proposes a per-sentence support verdict; this module
re-derives both the subject sentences (from the draft's own segmented
bindings) and the section bytes (from the block's own resolved bound
sections) and reconciles the account against those re-derived values, never
trusting either from the account's own copy. `supported` is the verdict that
lets a sentence reach substitution, so `supported` is the one this module
requires to be grounded (D1) -- the inversion of `contract-audit`'s own
asymmetry, where the *blocking* verdict is the one required to cite a span.

def _body_of(section: dict) -> str:
    """One bound section's text WITHOUT its own heading line.

    `paper_source_span.resolve_bound_sections` slices from the heading's own
    first byte -- `paper_guidance.segment_markdown` sets `byte_start` at the
    `#` rather than beneath it -- so `section["text"]` opens with the heading
    itself. For the verbatim check that is correct and must not change: pasting
    a source's heading into a draft IS copying it, and `SOURCE_SECTION_
    VERBATIM` should see it.

    For grounding it is wrong, and the difference is the whole point of this
    guard. A `supported` verdict citing only the section's TITLE -- no body
    text at all -- was byte-present in the full slice and therefore survived,
    licensing a sentence the section's body never supports. A title says what a
    section is about; it does not assert anything, so it cannot ground a claim.

    Fixed HERE rather than in `paper_source_span`, deliberately. That slicer is
    shared with the already-shipped verbatim check, which wants the heading
    included. Two checks wanting different things from the same bytes is not a
    reason to change the bytes -- it is a reason for each to derive what it
    needs. The same "sibling, never extension" rule this module already follows
    toward `check_source_section_verbatim`.

    A section whose text carries no newline at all is treated as heading-only
    and yields an empty body: nothing in it can ground anything, which is the
    safe direction.

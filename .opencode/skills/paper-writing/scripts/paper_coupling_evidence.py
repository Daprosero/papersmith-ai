"""paper_coupling_evidence: every disk read `verify` needs, isolated here
and nowhere else (`the-couplings-hold-or-they-do-not`, design.md, `skill-
local modules, an evidence seam, no _core/`).

Named `paper_coupling_evidence` rather than the proposal's own
`paper_evidence` because that name is already taken by
`no-claim-without-a-source-that-holds-it`'s claim<->source record module —
a real, landed, unrelated capability this change must not collide with
(measured on disk before naming this file).

This module reads bytes; it never checks them. Every check `paper_verify.py`
runs is a pure function of the `Evidence` object built here, so the AST
read-only lock (`tests/test_paper_writing.py`, `ReadOnlyTests`) can hold this
module to "reads only" and `paper_verify.py` to "touches disk never" as two
separate, independently provable claims.

`verify` reads its own declaration record from `paper/couplings.json` —
read-only, untracked like `main.tex` itself, and never the `declarations`
region `paper_declarations.py` owns (that region's payload shape is a
different capability's decision, not this one's — design.md, `one record,
one grammar, and this change writes none of it`). The `provenance` region
IS the same one `the-paper-carries-its-own-decisions` already writes at
`substitute --contract` time; this module only ever reads it, through
`paper_provenance.read_provenance`/`paper_provenance.drift` — never a second
implementation of the same digest comparison.

    object only so `paper_verify.run`'s report can name where evidence came
    from, never so a check can re-open a file `gather()` already read.

    `blocks_by_fact`: fact id -> `(block_ids, unmeasured_reason)`, for every
    fact in `paper_vocabulary.FACTS` — `block_ids` is empty and
    `unmeasured_reason` is set whenever the derivation could not produce a
    real block set (`SECTION_CONTRACTS_UNREADABLE` when the corpus itself
    could not be read at all, `NO_BLOCK_REQUIRES_FACT` when it could be read
    and simply names no block for that fact). Derived once here, through
    `paper_contract.parse` by way of `paper_graph.assemble_corpus` — never a
    record-declared fallback (design.md, `which blocks a check reads is
    derived, not hardcoded, and has exactly one source`).

    `block_bodies`: raw (unqualified) block id -> that block's body bytes,
    sliced from `main_tex_bytes` via `paper_block.parse` — the one place
    this module calls the block grammar's own parser, so `paper_verify.py`
    never has to (design.md, `verify never parses a marker: it calls
    paper_block.parse and slices bodies from the same bytes`).

    `contract_drift`: block id -> `bool | None`, for every block the
    `provenance` region names — `True` stale, `False` current, `None` when
    the recorded contract file itself could not be re-read. Computed via
    `paper_provenance.drift`, which this module is the only caller of, so
    `paper_verify.py`'s check B never opens a contract file itself.

    `producers_by_fact`: fact id -> `(producer_block_ids, unmeasured_
    reason)`, the PRODUCER counterpart to `blocks_by_fact` above
    (`a-fact-is-declared-or-it-is-produced`, design.md Decision F) —
    `producer_block_ids` are raw (unqualified) ids naming every block whose
    `produces_facts` names that fact, same `SECTION_CONTRACTS_UNREADABLE`
    fallback shape as `blocks_by_fact`. `check_gap` alone reads this field;
    `blocks_by_fact` itself is untouched, so `check_chain`'s own
    `zip(block_ids, links)` alignment is never at risk.

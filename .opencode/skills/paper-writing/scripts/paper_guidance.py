"""paper_guidance: per-folder `guidance/<folder>` class registry.

Classifies each folder under `guidance/` as `style-reference` or `evidence`
by reading a per-folder marker file, `guidance/<folder>/.paper-writing.json`
— never by reading the folder's name. A folder carrying no marker is
reported `unclassified`, including every folder on a fresh clone, where no
marker files exist yet. That is designed behavior, not a default and not a
fault (`specs/guidance-registry/spec.md`).

`guidance/` is not a fact source (`design.md`, `A fact the agent may
observe is a partition, not a guideline`); this registry feeds the
style/evidence classification `plan` reports AND, since
`the-skill-stops-trusting-memory` item 2/3, gates `validate --source-md`:
`classify_source_md` is what `paper_cli._build_evidence_record` calls to
refuse a quote sourced from a `style-reference`-classed folder and accept
one sourced from an `evidence`-classed folder -- the classification's own
first real consumer, not merely a label `plan` echoes back.

`ingested_papers(guidance_dir)` (`the-phases-are-derived-not-remembered`)
is a second, independent walk -- two levels deep, gitignore-blind by
`Path.iterdir()`'s own construction -- feeding `plan`/`packet`'s report of
which papers actually sit under `guidance/`.

`segment_markdown`/`read_markdown_outline` (unit 8, `redactor-packet`
spec) are a third, independent capability: a heading OUTLINE -- never
reference prose -- over one ingested paper's own markdown, which is what
lets `packet` hand the style-sampler agent a map of every reference
paper's structure without ever carrying a byte of its substantive
content itself (design.md, Decision D5).

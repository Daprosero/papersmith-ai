"""paper_latex: toolchain discovery, the one `latexmk` subprocess call, log
parsing, and the three-signal verdict.

The sole module this skill lets import `subprocess` — an AST scan in
`tests/test_paper_writing.py` (`NoSubprocessScanTests`) holds every other
`scripts/*.py` file to zero `subprocess`/`os.system`/`os.popen`/`os.exec*`/
`multiprocessing` imports, with this file as the one named exception
(`SUBPROCESS_EXCEPTIONS`). `paper_figure.py` calls `compile()` below; it
never spawns a process of its own (`a-diagram-that-compiles-or-says-why`
design.md, "three skill-local modules, none of them in `_core/`").

The compile's verdict never comes from the parser alone: exit status,
whether `<id>.pdf` was written, and whether the log's diagnostics explain
either outcome must all agree. Disagreement — a failed exit with zero
explained diagnostics, or a clean exit with errors parsed — refuses
`LATEX_OUTCOME_UNEXPLAINED` rather than silently reading as one or the
other (design.md, "the compile's verdict never comes from the parser").

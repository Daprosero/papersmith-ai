    edge is sourced in `sections/07-conclusions.md`, not its own
    `08-abstract.md`). Every file this function reads is already read
    exactly once, in the loop below — this adds no second disk pass.

    backed `after` edge (`_verify_internal_chain`) and that no prose
    heading announces a sub-unit the header never declared

    `REPOSITORY`-kind root never resolves under it at all. `None` derives
    `sections_dir.parent` — the real repository root under this skill's
    shipped layout. Every root's `document-rooted`/`unmeasured` status is
    computed once here (`Corpus.source_roots`) and then consumed by
    `_verify_source_section_bindings` below, which resolves and checks
    every `document`-bound `requires_facts` entry the parsed corpus names.

    `enforce_bindings` (U3b correctness repair, design.md Decision H):
    `False` (default) — a bindable, measured, unbound entry is reported
    in `Corpus.undecided_bindings`, never raised; every read-only verb
    keeps working on a corpus that still carries an undecided binding.
    `True` — the SAME condition can raise `SECTION_BINDING_ABSENT`, scoped
    by `enforce_for_block` below. Only `paper_cli._resolve_write_gate`
    (`write`'s own first statement) ever passes `True`: drafting a block
    without knowing which section feeds it is the one moment an undecided
    binding would otherwise force an invented answer, so only that moment
    refuses.

    `enforce_for_block` (U4 correctness repair, design.md: "the block this
    `write` call names, nothing else"): the qualified id `write` is
    actually about to draft. `None` (default) — every existing direct
    caller of `enforce_bindings=True` — raises on the FIRST entry
    `Corpus.undecided_bindings` names, corpus-wide, unchanged from before
    this parameter existed. A qualified id — `_resolve_write_gate`'s own
    call — raises ONLY if THAT block's own entry survives in
    `Corpus.undecided_bindings`; a sibling block's undecided binding stays
    a report, never a refusal for a block that never named it. This is
    the same argument `source-section-binding`'s own rationale already
    makes per block ("drafting a block without knowing which section
    feeds it is the one moment an undecided binding would otherwise force
    an invented answer"): that argument reaches the block being drafted,
    never its siblings — a block requiring no bindable fact at all cannot
    invent an answer for one, so it must not be gated on a sibling's
    unresolved binding. This does NOT consult `BlockRecord.optional`: an
    optional block that IS the one being written is still gated in full.

    `paper_dir` (U3e ruling, `the-requirement-names-the-section-that-
    feeds-it`, design.md Decision J): where `paper_declarations.
    read_bindings` looks for bindings RECORDED via `bind` — `None`
    derives `resolved_base / "paper"`, this skill's own shipped default
    layout (`<repo>/paper`), the SAME convention every existing test
    fixture already follows (`self.paper_dir = self.forge_root /
    "paper"`). Read once, before the block loop, and merged per block
    with that block's own header-declared bindings by
    `_reconcile_source_bindings` — never a second, independent source of

    """`source-section-binding` spec — every check a `document`-bound
    `requires_facts` entry (`BlockRecord.source_bindings`) is held to,
    against real disk. Inert for every entry with no `document` half (U1),
    and inert for every root `corpus.source_roots` reports `unmeasured`
    (design.md Decision B: an unmeasured root is reported, never a
    refusal) — resolution only ever runs against a `document-rooted` root.

    For each `(root, lineage)` pair the corpus's bindings actually name,
    under a document-rooted root, resolution branches on the root's OWN
    `kind` (design.md, `SourceRootKind`):

    1a. `PROSE`/`REPOSITORY` roots (a `REPOSITORY` root is never
        document-rooted, so it never reaches this branch in practice):
        `paper_declarations.read_revisions_marker` — `None` (absent
        marker) refuses `SOURCE_REVISIONS_UNDECLARED` naming the root; a
        malformed marker propagates `MALFORMED_SOURCE_MARKER` from the
        reader itself. `paper_declarations.resolve_lineage` then refuses
        `SOURCE_LINEAGE_UNRESOLVED` on zero or tied candidates.
    1b. `INGESTED` roots (U2c ruling): an ingested paper is not a
        revisioned lineage, so there is no marker to read at all —
        `paper_declarations.resolve_ingested_document` resolves the
        lineage by IDENTITY, refusing the SAME `SOURCE_LINEAGE_UNRESOLVED`
        on zero or more-than-one matching ingested document.
    2. The resolved document is segmented once (`paper_guidance.
       segment_markdown`) into a `{title: count}` memo, keyed by
       `(root, lineage)` — one file read per distinct pair for the WHOLE
       corpus (design.md Decision E), never one per binding. Every binding
       naming that pair is then a dict lookup: a zero count refuses
       `SECTION_NOT_IN_SOURCE`, a count above one refuses
       `SECTION_TITLE_AMBIGUOUS`, both naming the owning block and the
       title.

    0. (U3b correctness repair, `the-requirement-names-the-section-that-
       feeds-it` — U3's own unconditional version of this step forced an
       agent to INVENT two bindings rather than leave the corpus
       assemblable at all, which the owner ruled worse than the defect it
       fixed) `Corpus.undecided_bindings` already names every bindable,
       measured, unbound entry (`_compute_undecided_bindings`, run before
       this function, before `Corpus` even exists). `enforce_bindings=False`
       (every read-only verb's own default) leaves that report as a
       report: this step raises NOTHING for it. `enforce_bindings=True`
       (`write`'s own gate, and ONLY `write`'s) can turn a surviving entry
       into `SECTION_BINDING_ABSENT`, naming the owning block and the fact
       id — SCOPED by `enforce_for_block` (U4 correctness repair): `None`
       raises on the first entry `Corpus.undecided_bindings` names, in the
       SAME block order the old unconditional obligation loop used,
       corpus-wide — the shape every existing direct `enforce_bindings=True`
       caller still gets. A qualified id (`_resolve_write_gate`'s own
       call) raises ONLY when THAT block's own entry survives; a sibling
       block's undecided binding is left standing in the report, never
       raised for a block that does not name it — the per-block rationale
       above ("drafting a block without knowing which section feeds it is
       the one moment an undecided binding would otherwise force an
       invented answer") only ever reached the block being drafted, never
       its 46 siblings, and a block with no bindable fact at all cannot
       invent an answer for one. Either way the obligation stays
       UNCONDITIONAL for the block actually being enforced against, and
       still never consults `BlockRecord.optional`: an optional block that
       IS the one being written is still gated in full.

    wave the same way `derive_order` tie-breaks (`_sort_key`). Reuses
    `_build_graph` (design.md D2) — no second graph construction, no
    second sort key. Refuses `ORDER_CYCLE`, the identical detail string
    `derive_order` raises via the same `_extract_minimal_cycle`, when
    nodes remain unassigned once the frontier is exhausted.

    `derive_order`'s own min-heap holds ready nodes from SEVERAL frontiers
    at once (a node from wave 2 can out-rank, by `_sort_key`, a still-
    unpopped node from wave 1), so its flattened sequence legitimately
    interleaves waves. Flattening THIS function's waves is therefore never
    asserted equal to `derive_order`'s sequence — only that both name the
    same node set, and that every edge crosses a wave boundary
    (design.md D2, invariants 1/2/5; `specs/writing-phases/spec.md`).

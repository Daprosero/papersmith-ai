"""paper_source_span: a block's own resolved `(fact, lineage, title)`
bindings, turned into the bound section's own bytes (`transposition-fidelity`
spec, design.md Decision E).

This module never resolves lineage and never reads a revisions marker on its
own -- it CALLS `paper_graph.resolve_section_index`, the shipped per-
`(root, lineage)` chain `_verify_source_section_bindings` already reuses, and
adds only the byte slice. A second, independent resolution here is exactly
the defect this repository has already recorded under "fixed the instance,
never swept the class" (design.md, "Reconciling with the concurrent
change").

    own `BlockRecord.source_bindings` names, under a MEASURED,
    document-rooted root: `{"fact", "lineage", "title", "path",
    "byte_start", "byte_end", "text"}`. A block with no bindable measured
    fact returns `()` -- reported by the caller as `unmeasured`, never
    silently passed.

    Mirrors the same root/status guard `_verify_source_section_bindings`
    applies before ever calling `resolve_section_index` (an entry whose
    fact is not a key of `FACT_SOURCE_ROOT`, or whose root is reported
    `unmeasured`, is skipped rather than resolved) -- this function never
    invents a stricter or looser gate than the one `write`'s own corpus
    assembly already enforced for every binding it did resolve.

    `write`'s own gate (`_resolve_write_gate`, `enforce_bindings=True`)
    already raised `SECTION_NOT_IN_SOURCE`/`SECTION_TITLE_AMBIGUOUS` for
    every OTHER binding in the whole corpus before this function is ever
    called, so a title with any count other than exactly one here is
    skipped defensively rather than re-raised -- this module adds no
    refusal of its own (design.md, "Interfaces / Contracts").

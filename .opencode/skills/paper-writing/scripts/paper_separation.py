"""paper_separation: the pure core of the whole-cut review, design.md
Decisions B and D.

Two functions, no I/O, no CLI wiring, no persistence, no corpus assembly --
a caller resolves an outline and an anchored claim map first, and this
module answers two questions about them: which sections a block may claim
at all, and how badly a proposed cut breaks the document's own structure.

Public surface:

    claimable_sections(outline)              -> {"state", "level", "titles", "reason"}
    score_cut(claimable, claims_by_block)    -> {"orphan", "overlap", "gap", "total"}

def claimable_sections(outline: dict) -> dict:
    """Decision B: eliminate root spans to a fixed point, then take every
    remaining heading at the shallowest remaining level, ordered by
    `byte_start`.

    `outline` is `paper_guidance.segment_markdown`'s own return shape --
    `{"headings": [...]}`, each heading carrying `{title, level,
    byte_start, byte_end}`, or `{"headings": [], "reason": "NO_HEADINGS"}`
    for a document with no ATX heading at all.

    A heading `H` is a root span iff every OTHER remaining heading's
    `byte_start` lies strictly inside `[H.byte_start, H.byte_end)` -- it
    contains all of them, so it partitions nothing. A document carrying
    exactly one heading eliminates that heading too: "every other
    remaining heading" is an empty set, which is vacuously true.

    No heading-level literal governs this computation anywhere: the only
    comparison against a level is against `shallowest`, itself derived
    from whatever remains after elimination -- never a hardcoded bound. A
    document nested one level deeper, or one level shallower, needs no
    edit here.

    Returns `{"state": "measured"|"unmeasured", "level": int|None,
    "titles": tuple, "reason": str|None}`. `state` is `"unmeasured"` when
    the document carries no heading at all, or when elimination leaves
    nothing behind -- reporting a claimable set and exiting 0 in either
    case would let a cut pass because nothing was actually measured.

    (`claimable_sections(...)["titles"]`); `claims_by_block` maps each
    block id to the titles it claims -- already anchored by the caller,
    since this function has no corpus to check anything against. A title
    named in `claims_by_block` that is not itself in `claimable` (an
    unanchored assignment's title, or one resolved outside the claimable
    set entirely) is silently excluded from every count below: it clears
    no orphan and can create neither an overlap nor a gap.

    - **orphan**: every claimable title no block's claims name at all.
    - **overlap**: per title, `k - 1` where `k` is the number of DISTINCT
      blocks claiming it (0 when claimed by 0 or 1 block). Two blocks on
      one title cost 1; three cost 2 -- ambiguous at k >= 3 in the
      proposal's own telling; this is the ruling.
    - **gap**: per block, every claimable title strictly between that
      block's own minimum and maximum claimed title (by document order)
      that the block itself does not claim. A block claiming zero or one
      title can never contribute a gap.
    - **total**: `orphan + overlap + gap`. Lower is better; equal totals
      are not a regression, because nothing else is ranked.

    Returns `{"orphan": [title, ...], "overlap": [{"title", "blocks",
    "count"}, ...], "gap": [{"block", "title"}, ...], "total": int}` --
    every list names instances, so a refusal built from this can name
    every defect rather than the first.

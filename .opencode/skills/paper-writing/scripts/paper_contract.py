"""paper_contract: front-matter grammar and schema validation.

The header is JSON inside a `---` … `---` front-matter fence; `json.loads`
is all-or-nothing by construction, so "never parses partially" is
structural rather than a rule someone has to maintain. Everything below the
closing fence is prose — read as bytes and handed back unread, never
decoded for meaning.

**`install_header` was removed** (zero-production-caller corrective): it was
the one-shot tool that inserted front matter into the ten shipped
`sections/*.md` files, and that migration already ran and completed --
every shipped file carries its header today. Nothing in `SKILL.md`, a
published spec, or a registered agent promises an ongoing "create a new
section contract" workflow, so this module no longer touches disk bytes at
all; it only parses what is already there.

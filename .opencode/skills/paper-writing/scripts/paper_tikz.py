"""paper_tikz: the TikZ optimization transforms — pure text-to-text, no
filesystem, no compile, no CLI (`a-diagram-that-compiles-or-says-why`'s
optimization capability).

This module owns no subprocess and no `Refused` of its own. It is a pure
function library: `optimize()` takes a source string and returns an
`OptimizeResult` carrying the rewritten text plus what changed. The
pipeline that decides whether a rewritten candidate may reach disk —
stop A, the manifest cross-check, the compile, the atomic commit — is
`paper_figure.optimize_figure()`'s, never this module's.

Grammar honesty: like `paper_block.py`, this module does NOT implement a
LaTeX or TikZ grammar. It reads a marker-first source with shallow regexes:
`\\usetikzlibrary{...}` lines, `\\node`/`\\draw`/`\\path` option lists, and
the `% node: <label>` comment markers this skill already treats as its own
declaration grammar (`paper_figure._NODE_MARKER_RE`). A regex rewrite that
claims to be an AST is the failure mode this note exists to prevent.

Two transforms are deliberately conservative, because a naive version of
either silently changes rendering:

* **Library pruning** only ever removes a library this module knows how to
  detect AND whose trigger is absent. A library outside the detection map
  (say `intersections`, `decorations.markings`) is never removed — this
  module cannot prove it unused, so it does not pretend to.
* **`\\tikzset` factoring** only fires on byte-identical option lists that
  carry no positional key, no placeholder, and no baked-in coordinate or
  node reference, and never re-factors a site that already carries a
  generated `ps-` style. Style names are a pure function of the canonical
  options string, which is what makes
  `optimize(optimize(x)).text == optimize(x).text` structural rather than
  hoped for.

Public surface:

    OptimizeResult                                   -> the rewrite and its changes
    scan_libraries(tex) -> set[str]                  -> every \\usetikzlibrary member

/**
 * What the shared deliberation engine needs to know about THIS domain.
 *
 * The engine under `_core/` is domain-neutral and refuses to start without one of
 * these. It manages revisions of a Markdown document, indexes it, patches it
 * byte-exactly and transacts the result -- none of which cares whether the
 * document argues about mathematics or about which runs a machine will execute.
 * This file is the second such domain, and the engine gained no line of code to
 * accommodate it.
 *
 * An EXPERIMENTS document is a plan for work that has not happened. Everything
 * below follows from that one sentence: the tables are empty because a run fills
 * them, the URLs carry a verification tag because nobody has necessarily reached
 * them, and the data paper bounds what may be claimed because a claim the data
 * cannot support is not an experiment, it is a wish.
 */

/**
 * Sentences that assert an outcome. `detectConflicts` below is a pure function of
 * the candidate's bytes -- the profile knows what its own bound source asserts,
 * with no engine-level file I/O, exactly as `preservation.extractAtoms` knows its
 * own canonical form -- and what the data paper asserts, always, is that this
 * document plans work rather than reports it. So the detectable conflict is an
 * ACHIEVED result: an experiments document that says a model already won has
 * stepped past the one source that bounds it.

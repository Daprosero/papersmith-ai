 * This domain's preservation gate, wired through `profile.ts` as
 * `preservation.{extractAtoms, violations}`. The shared core knows only about
 * atoms, deltas and violations in the abstract; everything below is what an
 * EXPERIMENTS document is, and it is deliberately nothing like the mathematical
 * sibling's notation rules.
 *
 *   1. `extractAtoms` -- what does this document declare that must never vanish
 *      in silence? Reported on preview as `preservationDelta`, and refused on
 *      accept unless the caller acknowledges each lost one by id.
 *   2. `violations` -- does the candidate still spell an experiments document the
 *      one way that keeps it honest? Never intentional, so this blocks outright.
 *
 * Nothing here reads `DOMAIN`. That is a property worth keeping rather than an
 * accident: this module can then be exercised directly, in process, under a test
 * run whose single `DELIBERATION_DOMAIN_PROFILE` belongs to another domain.
 *
 * ## Why an experiments document needs its own gate at all
 *
 * The mathematical atom set is worthless here -- an experiments document has no
 * `$$`, no `\tag`, so that extractor returns an empty map and the gate passes
 * vacuously. A vacuous pass is worse than no gate, which is exactly why the core
 * distinguishes "nothing to check" (`preservationApplicable: false`) from
 * "checked and passed", and why the five atom kinds below are the things this
 * document is actually made of.

 * external URL in an experiments document carries exactly one of two tags,

 * An untagged URL is refused. That is the point: the default is the violation,
 * so a URL a model invented from memory cannot be published by saying nothing,
 * and the run date makes a stale verification visible instead of permanent. The
 * date must be a full `YYYY-MM-DD`; a bare year is not a run.
 *
 * "Immediately after" is load-bearing too. A tag anywhere on the line would let
 * one verified URL vouch for an unverified neighbour, so the tag must be the
 * next non-blank thing after the URL ends. The only bytes allowed to sit between
 * them are the ones the URL was wrapped in or ended by: a Markdown link's closing

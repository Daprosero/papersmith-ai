"""geometry: connected ink regions, bounding boxes, out-of-bounds,
overlap and canvas occupancy -- computed in pure Python, no numpy or
scipy (design.md, Decision 1: "the expensive step is connected-component
labelling, which numpy does not provide -- scipy.ndimage.label does, and
scipy is neither declared nor installed").

No `subprocess` here; this module never spawns a process and never reads
a repair-budget ledger.

One threshold, 8-connectivity, both recorded by every caller that builds
a finding (design.md, Decision 6): `INK_MAX_LEVEL = 200` on the 0-255
grayscale scale separates the two populations it must -- anti-aliasing
halo at a stroke's edge lands ~230-254 (outside ink), a deliberate light
TikZ fill such as `fill=black!25` renders at level ~=191 (inside ink).
8-connectivity, because 4-connectivity fragments an anti-aliased
diagonal stroke into many mutually-overlapping components, which would
report a false `overlap: fail` on a single clean arrow.

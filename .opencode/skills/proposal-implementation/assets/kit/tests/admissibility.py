"""The admissibility ruling, read before any remedy is measured.

Order is the point. Whether a correction is sound and expressible inside the
proposal is decided first; whether it resolves the finding is measured only
afterwards. Running the sweep on a remedy that cites a missing equation, or
leans on notation the revision never defines, produces numbers that read as
evidence and lend rigour to something that should not have reached the bench.

The ruling is produced by `implementation_cli.py admit --revision <rNN>`, which
reads the revision in the forge and writes only its verdict here. Without it,
every remedy test fails immediately.

"""Audit findings on the proposal, each with the remedy it proposes.

A finding is a defect in the mathematics itself: a term that is ill-formed, a
claim stated more strongly than the construction supports, a missing complement
the rest of the development assumes, or a constant that does not hold up. It is
not a bug in this code.

The contract, checked statically by `implementation_cli.py verify`:

- every `id` has a `test_finding_<id>` proving the defect is real, measured over
  the sweep, and a `test_remedy_<id>` proving the fix resolves it AND preserves
  what was already established;
- `status` is `theorem` (holds across the whole sweep) or `tendency` (declares
  its measured rate and is never asserted as a law);
- `uses` is notation the remedy leans on and must appear verbatim in the
  revision; `introduces` is notation it would add, which keeps the audit at
  `needs-deliberation` because adding notation is the deliberation's call;
- `adoption.absent` is text present in the revision today whose disappearance
  signals the remedy was taken in; `expect` are forms that confirm it;
- `becomes_invariant` names what the remedy turns into once published: at that
  point the remedy test retires and the claim moves to the invariant suite;
- `remedy_block` is the corrected equation written out, exactly as it should
  read in the document, carrying the same `\\tag{n}` it replaces. A finding of
  local reach that omits it cannot be settled inline: the handoff defers it to
  a session of its own, because describing a correction in prose is not the
  same as writing it, and nothing here will paraphrase mathematics into a
  document. Findings that add notation are structural anyway and need none.

Remedies live in the tests, never in src/. Establishing that a correction is
sound is not the same as adopting it.

"""Total filesystem predicates for every framework-managed path.

A managed path is data a user can damage, and the framework's contract is to
report a damaged workspace rather than block on it or die inside it. Two
distinct hazards are therefore folded into ``False`` here:

* ``Path.is_file``, ``Path.is_dir`` and ``Path.exists`` re-raise every errno but
  ENOENT/ENOTDIR/EBADF/ELOOP, so an unsearchable parent (EACCES) escapes. On
  CPython 3.11-3.13 — which the declared ``requires-python`` covers — that
  includes the plain ``is_file`` this framework used to call directly. CPython
  3.14 changed which errnos ``_ignore_error`` swallows, so the same call returns
  ``False`` there: the guard is load-bearing on 3.11-3.13 and invisible on 3.14.
* A non-regular but *openable* path — a FIFO, or a symlink to a character
  device — makes the subsequent ``open(2)`` block forever or read without bound.
  A guarded read is not enough on its own; the regularity gate has to come
  first.

This module is deliberately dependency-free. ``core.config`` needs the same gate
``generators`` uses, and ``generators`` imports ``core.config``, so the guard
has to live below both of them.

    rewrite the version file, and nothing about order. So installing an
    older kit over a newer workspace rolled it back in silence and reported
    the older version as the new truth.

    This refuses at a decision point rather than reporting afterwards, the

    happened reads like weather. By the time the files are copied the

    means "write even when the bytes already match", and a caller asking
    for a redundant rewrite must not receive a version rollback as part of
    the bargain -- one flag answering two unrelated questions is how an
    operator gets a behaviour they never asked for.

    A workspace with no recorded version is not a downgrade: there is
    nothing to go backwards from, and refusing a first upgrade would block
    the case this guard was never about. A recorded version that cannot be
    ordered refuses instead, because the guard's whole claim is that one

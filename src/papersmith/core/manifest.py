"""Workspace and kit manifests: SHA-256 tracking, filtering, preservation.

Two manifests exist:

* ``kit-manifest.json`` at the kit root — hashes of every framework file the
  kit ships (written by ``scripts/build-kit.py``; computed on the fly when a
  development checkout has none).
* ``<workspace>/.papersmith/manifest.json`` — hashes of every
  framework-managed file as it exists in that workspace, plus the workspace
  version and update timestamp.

"""Every agent is bound to a skill, and every delegating skill to its agents.

The binding is TWO-WAY and both directions are held here, because either one
alone leaves something dead. An agent that names no skill has no rules; a skill
that names no agent has agents nobody invokes -- and an agent nobody invokes is
a file, not a boundary. That second failure already happened once in this
repository and the file was deleted rather than kept.


An agent definition is the one place the purpose reaches a session BEFORE
anything happens: its `description` is the first thing in context on every
invocation. The skill declares the north and every refusal carries it, so it
arrives when you are blocked and when you ask -- and an agent is what makes it
arrive at the start, which is where losing it is cheapest to prevent.

That only holds while the two agree. A description that drifts from the
declared arrival is a north nobody updated, and the agent would open every
session with a destination the skill no longer has. So the arrival is read out
of the skill and asserted in the description rather than proof-read.

Stdlib only, for the same reason `test_suite_collects.py` is: this has to
survive an environment missing everything else.

# was-for`, slice A4, design.md D9): a second implementation profile
# (`experimental-implementation`) now exists on disk, so `buildDenylist`'s
# "others" set is non-empty and the lock is satisfiable rather than
# vacuous. This comment previously recorded why it was deferred; it is kept
# here, corrected, as the historical reason the deferral existed at all --
# never a `skipTest`, which would have moved the pinned `OK (skipped=6)`
# baseline this cut is not allowed to move.


# --- C3: the replacement lock, proven by reading, not by counting --------
#
# D10's single-document guarantee (Cut 3 slice A, `SingleDocumentGuarantee
# Tests`) is DELETED here (task 4.4, spec `experimental-implementation-
# skill` Requirement "A Two-Document Guarantee Is Proven By Reading, Not
# By Counting"): it proved only that `documents` stayed length 1 --
# necessary while `_extra_document_fidelity_status` fed every index the
# SAME four shared, document-count-invariant conditions (a `documents[1]`
# declared before this slice would have yielded a fidelity status that
# read green having measured nothing). Now that the fold genuinely reads
# each document's own claim-key scope (C2a) and its own citation pattern
# (C2b), a documents-count check alone is no longer the property that
# matters -- `TwoDocumentReadProvenTests` below replaces it, proving the
# per-document READ against the shipped skill's own two now-declared
# documents, and catching a reversion of that read even though the count
# stays two throughout.

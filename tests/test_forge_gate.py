"""The forge's own gate, derived on both sides rather than restated.

`openspec/config.yaml` names the command that has to pass before any apply or
verify slice may call itself done. That command is prose in a YAML file:
nothing executes it at authoring time, so a discovery pattern that reaches one
suite out of six reads exactly like a pattern that reaches all six, and an
interpreter that cannot import what the suites import reads exactly like one
that can. Both failures are silent, and both were real here.

Every lock below derives its two halves instead of asserting a literal. The
suites are whatever `tests/` holds today; the pattern is whatever the
configured command carries today; the interpreter is driven as a process and
asked to import the module that decides the answer. A restated command string
would have to be edited alongside the defect it was meant to catch, which is
the same silence one indirection later.

"""Cut 2 (`the-domain-crosses-the-seam`), design.md D8: mutation proof,
both directions, per leaf.

**Removal** is already proven for all sixteen leaves by
`test_implementation_profile.py`'s `DomainFieldLeafRefusalTests` -- each
raises `IMPLEMENTATION_DOMAIN_PROFILE_INCOMPLETE` naming its own leaf. This
file is the OTHER half: **change**. A real, reverted mutation moves the
digest D1 predicted -- or, where measurement disagrees with prediction, the
digest actually measured, recorded honestly (design.md's own warning: Cut 1
shipped a false git-rename prediction, and this cut's own predictions are
claims apply must measure, never facts to cite).

**Never a monkeypatch** (the scar Cut 1 recorded and this cut carries
forward): every seal case is a real subprocess, so patching
`impl_domain_profile.PROFILE` or any engine attribute in-process has ZERO
effect on it. Every mutation here is a REAL file on disk -- a scratch copy
of `impl_profile.py`, with `kit.root`/`cli.path`/`documents.directory`'s
own base kept anchored to the real skill directory so only the ONE leaf
under test differs from the shipped profile -- reached by a REAL
`IMPLEMENTATION_DOMAIN_PROFILE` environment override on a REAL subprocess.
The shipped `impl_profile.py` is never edited by this file.

**Anchor discipline** (design.md D8): before every mutation, the real
source's occurrence count for the OLD spelling is asserted to be exactly 1
(so the substitution is unambiguous) and the NEW spelling to be absent; the
scratch copy is then asserted 0/1. An anchor that matched is not a mutation
that ran.

**Measured, not assumed.** Seven of the fourteen change-tested leaves below
did NOT move any of the 28 sealed cases against these particular fixtures,
despite a mover predicted in design.md D1. Each is recorded here as an
explicit ZERO-MOVER: its removal-refusal (above) and its lock coverage
(`test_implementation_domain_lock.py`) are its whole defence, per design.md
D8's own instruction -- never papered over, never hunted for a test that
would have moved it.

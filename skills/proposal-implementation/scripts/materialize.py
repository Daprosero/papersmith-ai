"""Drop the materialization kit into a target repository.

The forge's own harness, never a step of Flow A: an agent fills the scaffold
gaps by reading step 5, and this plays that part so the suite can examine a
freshly scaffolded target. It fills exactly the gaps the skill reports,
parameterized by the scenario's name and seed, and writes no step-9 template —
those answer an object map that does not exist at scaffold time.

    python3 materialize.py <target> <Name> <seed> [kit-directory]

The kit defaults to the skill's own templates. The forge's harness passes a
neutral fixture kit instead: a paper forge must not carry one paper's content.

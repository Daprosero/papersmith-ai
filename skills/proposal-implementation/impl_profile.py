"""This skill's own Cut-1 domain profile for the shared implementation
engine (`_core/implementation/engine/implementation_engine.py`).

Mirrors `domain-profile.ts`'s `artifact.directory`-style resolution: every
value here is computed from THIS file's own location, which moves as one
unit with the skill -- never from the engine's location, which the launcher
(`scripts/implementation_cli.py`) sets `IMPLEMENTATION_DOMAIN_PROFILE` to
point at.

Cut-1 field set (design.md D3, amended 2026-09-11 -- operator ruling on task
7.5's non-interference finding), each earning its place by being read:

- `kit.root` -> the engine's `SKILL_ROOT` (19 reader lines). Non-optional:
  `SKILL_ROOT` breaks the instant the engine moves, and breaks silently.
- `cli.path` -> the engine's `CLI_PATH` -> `CLI_INVOCATION` -> 4 message
  builders. Cut 1's single silent failure mode, and the mutation surface for
  R2/D4: one line in this file, instead of an edit inside 17,100.
- `objective` -> the engine's `OBJECTIVE_FLOW`, moved here VERBATIM (the
  text does not change; this is a relocation, not a rewrite). Read TWICE
  from outside the engine: stamped into every refusal this skill's engine
  invocation raises (`impl_domain_profile.py`'s own module docstring), and
  discovered by `tests/test_agents.py`'s cross-skill north lock, which walks
  THIS SKILL'S OWN directory tree (never the engine's) for a literal
  module-level `OBJECTIVE_FLOW` assignment -- which is exactly why it must
  physically live here and not in the shared engine: a second skill built on
  this same engine needs its OWN north, different stages, different
  arrival, and cannot get one by editing the engine, which is precisely what
  this seam exists to prevent (see the archived
  `2026-09-09-a-north-a-second-domain-can-hold` precedent on the
  deliberation side, where `proposal-deliberation/profile.ts` and
  `experimental-deliberation/profile.ts` each declare their own `objective`
  and `_core/deliberation/engine/domain-profile.ts` hardcodes neither).

Cut-2 field set (`the-domain-crosses-the-seam`, design.md D1/D7), fifteen
leaves landed one at a time (S3-S9), plus `vocabulary.names` landed at S13
alongside the two neutrality locks it exists to serve. Each carries TODAY'S
EXACT LITERAL BYTES the engine used to hardcode -- a profile supplying the
same literal composes the same output, which is what keeps all 28 sealed
digests byte-identical (design.md's whole bar). See design.md D1's table for
each leaf's reader and its predicted digest mover; D2 for why the provenance
side shares one read/write leaf per key while the findings side splits read
keys from wire keys; D6 for why `documents.label`'s value ("proposal") is
NOT a member of `vocabulary.names` below -- that word collides with 78 of
152 campaign-proposal hits elsewhere in this engine and is governed by its
own three-layer exclusion test instead.

`document_reader`, `cli_invocation`, `provenance.drift_unit_key`,
`provenance.revision_key`, `documents.marker` remain out of scope --
`provenance.drift_unit_key` does not exist at all (it IS the shared coarse
key `"sections"`, kept hardcoded in the engine by the B2 ruling); the other
four carry their own recorded reasons in design.md D1.

#: WHY THIS SKILL WAS INVOKED, AND WHERE IT HAS TO ARRIVE.
#:
#: Declared, invariant, and deliberately independent of anything on disk.
#: Every other reading the engine does answers *where am I* by measuring
#: products -- `walk` the ledger, `flowActs` what is owed, `flowDestination`
#: the rung. This answers a question none of them can: *what is this for*.
#: A session that hits an error, an interruption, or a gap consults it,
#: locates itself, resolves what blocks, and rejoins -- rather than
#: improvising forward, which is what an agent does when a blocker detaches
#: it from the purpose.
#:
#: **It is not the agreements and does not replace them.** What the
#: mathematics says lives in the managed revision; what was settled about
#: this repository lives in its `AGREED.md`. This says only what the skill
#: is FOR, which is the one thing neither of those states and no artefact
#: implies.
#:
#: Each stage names what it establishes and how a reader knows it is behind
#: them. The conditions are written to be READ, not computed: a stage
#: derived from products would make the purpose depend on the products,
#: which is exactly the dependency this exists without.
#:
#: Discovered by `tests/test_agents.py::_python_objective` as a module-level
#: literal named exactly `OBJECTIVE_FLOW` -- never wrap this in a function
#: call or a derived expression, or that AST-literal walk stops finding it.

"""This skill's own domain profile for the shared implementation engine
(`_core/implementation/engine/implementation_engine.py`), the SECOND host
built on the seam Cut 1/2/3 cut for it (change
`the-second-skill-the-seam-was-for`, slice A).

Every value here is computed from THIS file's own location, mirroring
`proposal-implementation/impl_profile.py` exactly (design.md D1/D2) --
`kit.root` and `cli.path` are structurally identical in shape (both derived
from `Path(__file__).resolve().parent`), never from the engine's location.
The launcher (`scripts/implementation_cli.py`) is a byte-identical copy of
the sibling's own launcher (design.md D4/M4): every path in it is
self-anchored off `Path(__file__).resolve()`, so the same 24 bytes placed
here resolve to THIS skill's own profile, never the sibling's.

**Scope, Slice A (design.md, proposal.md): change A only.** A single
declared document -- `documents[0]` is the `experiments/` directory,
label `experiments` (design.md D1). The mathematical proposal document,
cross-document agreement, and the successor composer were follow-on
changes (B, C, D), not built at Slice A. This profile's `documents` list
held exactly ONE entry, to that shape held by
`tests/test_implementation_domain_lock.py`'s single-document guard
(design.md D10).

**Scope, Slice C (`the-second-document-verified-on-its-own-terms`,
design.md D8/M2): `documents[1]` now declares the mathematical proposal**
-- its own complete per-document vocabulary overlay (`claim_key`
`"equations"`, matching `proposal-implementation`'s own established
vocabulary for this domain), landed as this change's LAST write, after
the per-document fold and per-document citation matching it depends on
were already proven against a fixture the shipped fold could not pass
(design.md D8's own ordering argument). The single-document guard this
scope note used to name is deleted; `tests/test_implementation_domain_
lock.py`'s `TwoDocumentReadProvenTests` replaces it, proving the
per-document READ rather than merely counting two entries.

**`vocabulary.names` (design.md D6, the M1 finding).**
`LockADiscoveryTests.test_every_declared_name_really_is_that_domain_speaking`
was vacuous for every profile, this skill's included, because it searched
`entry["source"]` -- the profile file's own text, which trivially contains
every literal in its own `names` list. The lock itself changes (design.md
D6): the haystack becomes the profile's declared VALUES (every leaf other
than `vocabulary.names` itself, rendered as text), so a declared name must
actually equal some OTHER leaf's real value to be found -- never merely
exist as a literal in this file's source.

Declared here: the namespace word `experimental-implementation` (found via
`kit.root`'s own path text, the same reason `experimental-deliberation`
records for its own namespace word), plus every subject-vocabulary value
measured ABSENT (`\\bword\\b == 0`, case-insensitive) from
`implementation_engine.py` -- admitting a word the engine already spells as
general machinery would immediately redden `LockBEngineNeutralityTests`.
Measured this session, word-boundary, case-insensitive, whole-word
occurrence counts (never line counts -- see the-second-skill-the-seam-
was-for's apply-progress record for the line-count figures 89/30/28, which
answer a different question):

    experiment            24   -- EXCLUDED (general engine vocabulary)
    experiments             6   -- EXCLUDED (general engine vocabulary)
    experimento             0   -- admitted
    experimentos            0   -- admitted
    experimentation         0   -- admitted
    experimentación    0   -- admitted
    protocol                 1   -- EXCLUDED (one comment, "the protocol")

So `names` is the namespace word plus the four measured-absent forms --
never `experiment`/`experiments`/`protocol`, which the engine already
spells for reasons that have nothing to do with this domain.

"""paper_figure_audit: semantic parity between a TikZ figure and the prose
that describes it — `figure audit`'s engine, and `verify`'s eighth check's.

**The audit's unit of truth is the manifest's `components`**, never every
string inside a `\\node{}`. Decorative labels (`x`, `y`, `\\small`) are not
components and must never be reported as phantom ones; `node_texts` and
`edges` are corroborating evidence in the report, never the verdict's
subject. That boundary is what keeps this module from colliding with
`paper_obligation.check_components` (manifest ↔ fact-derived expected list)
and `check_excluded` (manifest ↔ contract `excludes`), which this module
**reuses rather than re-derives**.

**A content finding is never a CLI refusal.** `check_excluded` raises
`Refused`; this module catches it, records the code and a `fail` verdict as
a finding, and lets the call exit 0. Only an unreadable invocation refuses,
and it reuses `DIAGRAM_SOURCE_ABSENT` / `SECTION_CONTRACTS_UNREADABLE`
rather than inventing a second code for a condition the repo already names.

**The verdict is `paper_verify`'s own closed vocabulary** — `pass` | `fail`
| `unmeasured`. Warnings ride in a separate `warnings` list; there is no
uppercase `WARN` status, and no `status` key at all, because
`paper_cli.main` spreads a result over its own framework `status`
(`paper_cli.py`, `{"status": "ok", ..., **result}`) and a result field named
`status` would silently override it. `unmeasured` exists for the same reason
it exists in `paper_verify.py`: folding "could not check" into `pass` is the
exact false-green this repository builds tests to catch.

Dependency direction is one-way and enforced by construction:
`paper_coupling_evidence.py` MAY import this module;
this module MUST NOT import `paper_verify.py` or
`paper_coupling_evidence.py` (`paper_verify.py` is AST-locked to `re`, so
it could not import this one even if it wanted to).

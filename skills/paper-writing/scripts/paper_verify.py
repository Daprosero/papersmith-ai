"""paper_verify: eight pure checks over a `paper_coupling_evidence.Evidence`,
and the report they assemble into (`the-couplings-hold-or-they-do-not`).

Every function below is a pure function of an already-built `Evidence`
object — no `Path`, no `open`, no disk read anywhere in this module
(`tests/test_paper_writing.py`, `ReadOnlyTests`'s AST lock holds this file
to exactly that). `skill-audit`'s shape throughout: derive both sides where
a side can be derived, publish the provenance of every side that cannot,
report, never repair.

`CHECKS` is one closed roster (contribution-list, chain, gap, artefacts,
future-work, citations, contract-currency, figure-semantics); `run()` is
held to producing
exactly one report object per member, in both directions
(`ReportShapeTests`). `UNMEASURED_REASONS` is a second closed roster; every
member is proven reachable by a fixture elsewhere in the suite.

Verdict vocabulary is `pass` | `fail` | `unmeasured` — deliberately NOT
`paper_vocabulary.VERDICTS` (`holds`/`does-not-hold`/`insufficient`), which
belongs to a different domain entirely (WU1's claim<->source citation
verdicts). Reusing that vocabulary here would conflate two unrelated
judgments that happen to both be three-valued; `specs/coupling-
verification/spec.md`'s own `Requirement: Verdict Vocabulary And
Classification Field` names `pass|fail|unmeasured` explicitly, and this
module follows the spec's normative wording over design.md's one
illustrative JSON snippet (which used `holds|fails` loosely) — noted as a
documentation inconsistency in this change's own apply report, not silently
carried forward into a second live vocabulary.

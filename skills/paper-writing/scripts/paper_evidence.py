"""paper_evidence: the claim<->source record whose load-bearing element is a
verbatim quoted span of an ingested `.md` -- the thing that turns a citation
verdict from an opinion into a measurement anyone can re-check
(`no-claim-without-a-source-that-holds-it`, `evidence-set` spec).

Public surface:

    EvidenceSpan.locate(md_path, quote)  -> EvidenceSpan   (raises SPAN_NOT_IN_SOURCE)
    Verdict.holds(span, reason="")        -> Verdict
    Verdict.does_not_hold(span, reason="") -> Verdict
    Verdict.insufficient(reason)          -> Verdict
    EvidenceRecord.from_verdict(...)      -> EvidenceRecord
    append_record(paper_dir, record, ...) -> dict
    read_records(paper_dir, block_id)     -> list[dict]
    read_all_records(paper_dir)           -> list[dict]
    write_evidence_manifest(folder, section_id, papers) -> dict

No I/O toward the network anywhere in this module -- resolution and metadata
live in `paper_resolve.py`; this module only ever reads bytes already on
disk (`design.md`, Decision 2 and 6).

**`classify_guidance_child` was removed** (zero-production-caller
corrective): it was a second, competing `guidance/` classifier alongside
`paper_guidance.read_registry` -- name-plus-manifest here versus a
per-folder `.paper-writing.json` marker there. `plan` and the
`style-sampler` agent (`.claude/agents/style-sampler.md`: "that
classification belongs to `plan`'s own registry") both already resolve the
evidence/style distinction through `paper_guidance.py`, so this function
was a duplicate mechanism with no consumer, never the missing wire.

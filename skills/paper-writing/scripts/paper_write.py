"""paper_write: the `write` pipeline — readiness, gate, draft, evidence-
audit, contract-audit, `substitute --contract` — with exactly one bounded
re-draft, enforced through an on-disk attempt ledger rather than counted
in-process (`writing-orchestration` spec; `design.md`, Decision D7).

The CLI is a judge, never an invoker (`design.md`, Decision D2): `draft` and
`audit_account` below are JSON envelopes an agent already produced and
handed back through `--draft`/`--audit`. This module never drafts, never
audits, never spawns anything — it reconciles what it is given against
`main.tex` and either writes or refuses.

"""paper_provenance: the `provenance` region — per written block, the
contract digest and declaration generation it stood on at write time.

Written once, at `substitute --contract` time, and never reconstructed
afterward. `plan` (Slice C2) reads it, names drift, and rewrites nothing.

Deliberately does NOT import `paper_block.py`: `paper_block.substitute`
imports THIS module (to write a provenance record after its own 9-step
write succeeds), so the reverse import would be circular. Every function
here takes an already-resolved `tex_path: Path` rather than a `paper_dir`,
one level lower than `paper_declarations.py`'s own disk-path resolution.

Public surface:

    record_write(tex_path, block_id, contract_path, *, clock=...) -> dict
        (raises PROVENANCE_HAND_EDITED; the contract's own readability is
        the CALLER's job — `paper_block.substitute` checks
        `CONTRACT_UNREADABLE` before calling this, per design.md's ordering
        requirement: the check happens before any main.tex byte is
        written, and never reorders any pre-existing `substitute` refusal)
    read_provenance(main_tex_bytes) -> dict|None
    declarations_generation(main_tex_bytes) -> int
    drift(main_tex_bytes, block_id, contract_path) -> bool|None
        (None means `unprovenanced` — never treated as current or drifted)

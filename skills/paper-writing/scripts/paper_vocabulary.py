"""paper_vocabulary: the three closed vocabularies a section contract's
header may draw from, and nothing else.

No I/O, no state — pure tuples plus a validator per tuple. A consumer that
only needs the vocabulary (a later phase, or a roster derivation) imports
this module alone and drags in no reader, no disk access
(design.md, `Internal layering`).

#: Transposition-Mode Block Is Checked, Mode Derived From The Contract On

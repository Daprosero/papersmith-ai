"""The contract a Cut-1 implementation domain fills in, and the resolver
that finds it.

The moved engine (`_core/implementation/engine/implementation_engine.py`)
serves no domain of its own: it resolves its host from
`IMPLEMENTATION_DOMAIN_PROFILE` and refuses to start without one, mirroring
`skills/_core/deliberation/engine/domain-profile.ts`'s resolver
properties exactly -- no default, fails closed at import, absolute path
required, nested required-key validation, path values validated, named
refusal codes.

`ImplementationProfileError(RuntimeError)`, never `Refused`/`NameRefused`
(design.md D3, three independent reasons):

1. The TS precedent throws a plain `Error`, not the engine's own domain
   refusal type.
2. The engine's JSON error renderer lives inside a module that has not
   finished importing when this resolves, and a second, duplicated renderer
   here is new surface for a state the launcher never produces.
3. Collateral: `reachable_refusal_codes()`, part of this suite's own
   coverage lock, walks every `*.py` under `_core/implementation/` for
   `Refused`/`NameRefused` constructions and pins its derived count at a
   fixed number. Six `Refused`s in a core module would move that unrelated
   pin -- a behavioural-delta-adjacent edit to a guard this change does not
   touch. A distinctly-named exception is invisible to that walk.

Cut-1 field set (design.md D3, amended 2026-09-11 -- operator ruling on task
7.5's non-interference finding): `kit.root` (the engine's `SKILL_ROOT`, 19
reader lines), `cli.path` (the engine's `CLI_PATH` -> `CLI_INVOCATION`), and
`objective` (the engine's `OBJECTIVE_FLOW` -- stamped into every refusal AND
discovered by the suite's cross-skill north lock (`test_agents.py`), which
walks a skill's OWN directory tree for a literal `OBJECTIVE_FLOW` assignment).
Nothing else -- a profile field nothing reads cannot be mutation-proven, and
an unprovable field is the shape of a false guard; `objective` earns its
place by that exact rule, now that it is read twice from outside the engine.

#: Cut 3 (`a-revision-is-two-documents`, design.md D4): `documents` is a

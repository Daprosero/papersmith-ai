Stdlib only, no venv, no network except through `structure`'s opt-in `driver`

sorted keys and returns an integer status, so a caller can hold the output to a

    The eleven earlier moves all ask whether the subject is correct; this

    recipe declares: a state the recipe or subject marks a human judgement
    is `judgement`, reported and never a finding -- publishing a command for
    a judgement would be worse than the silence. A state with no such
    declaration is searched, through the recipe's own declared `site` and

    reported with the driveable range that was searched.

    A found act passes an admission gate before any process starts: split
    into a list of strings or refused, no shell metacharacter, and its
    `argv[0]` resolved under `--subject`, under `--repo-root`, or named in
    the recipe's own declared interpreter allowlist -- anything else is

    never reads the act's own exit code: the requirement is that the act can
    be reached, not that it succeeds.

    identical is reported as having produced nothing, whatever it exited.

    partly outside its declared `roots` is reported as writing into a tree
    it does not own. Separately, and independently of any one step, the

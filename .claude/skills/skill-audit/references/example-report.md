# Audit: an example subject, one closed surface

This report is shipped as a worked example, so `check-report` has something to
accept in the reference beside the invocation that validates it.

## Ranked findings

### F1. The accepted set is restated by hand and derived nowhere

- Move: 0
- Evidence: CONFIRMED by execution
- Found by: not-compared
- Adjudication: doctrine wrong
- Digest: sha256:f9f163e09a5078c732f596f31c660b4229a97eec1e4fa5de3b6b09eef93ad6e3
- Code side: `engine/host.mjs:320`
- Doctrine side: `SKILL.md:243`
- Detail: the running host names its own accepted set in its refusal; the
  table beside it is a complement and states a different one.

## Not adjudicable

- Delete: (none)
- Update: (none)
- Undecided: F3

### F2. A declared value nothing anywhere reads

- Move: 0
- Evidence: CONFIRMED by execution
- Found by: not-compared
- Adjudication: not adjudicable
- Digest: sha256:f9f163e09a5078c732f596f31c660b4229a97eec1e4fa5de3b6b09eef93ad6e3
- Code side: `engine/metrics.ts:3`
- Doctrine side: `engine/host.mjs:319`
- Detail: enumeration found no consumer, so the question is not which half is
  wrong. Build-or-delete, and the choice costs something either way.

### F3. A guarded fact's mutation leaves its declared run green

- Move: 6
- Evidence: CONFIRMED by execution
- Found by: not-compared
- Adjudication: not adjudicable
- Digest: sha256:f9f163e09a5078c732f596f31c660b4229a97eec1e4fa5de3b6b09eef93ad6e3
- Remedy: undecided: degenerate fixture -- the fixture's own correct answer
  already equals the mutant's output
- Reachability: silent: this proves the guarded fact's lock did not fire
  against this one mutation; it does not prove every consumer of the fact
  was exercised
- Code side: `engine/host.mjs:410`
- Doctrine side: `tests/host.spec.mjs:88`
- Detail: substituting the declared literal at `engine/host.mjs:410` and
  re-running `tests/host.spec.mjs:88` left the suite green; condition 2
  confirms the byte changed, but nothing here proves the fixture's own
  input still discriminates the two values.

## Undecidable

- Kind: no-closed-roster
- Rung: readers

## Computed-value provenance

## Disputed severity

## Clean, stated as results

- The refusal path writes nothing - enumerated by driving the host from an
  empty directory, observed that directory empty before the run and after it.

## Unchecked

- The error-code surface - never enumerated, and therefore not claimed clean.

## Falsifier

Rename the heading the recipe quotes and the scope claim stops being honoured,
which would move this surface out of the complement case entirely.

"""Turn a worker id into a `CredentialHandle`, by running one command.

This module is the ONLY producer of a `CredentialHandle` anywhere above the
adapter seam. It builds one by running the credential owner's own
non-interactive materialize command as a CHILD PROCESS and reading exactly
one field off its stdout — never by opening a file itself, never by
importing that command's module directly. `subprocess`, `json`, `pathlib`
and this skill's own `adapter.py` are the whole list of what this file
imports; there is no `open`, no `Path.read_text`, no `Path.read_bytes`
anywhere in it.

That is what makes the structural claim true rather than merely stated: a
credential VALUE cannot enter this process's memory, not because a rule
says not to, but because nothing this module's own dependency graph is
even capable of reading one. The value is read by exactly two processes in
the whole system, neither of them this one: the materialize command's own
child process, and whatever service client a concrete adapter eventually
hands the returned directory to.

Run with any Python 3.10+ (stdlib-only):

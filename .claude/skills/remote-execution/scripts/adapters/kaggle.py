"""The Kaggle backend adapter — the ONLY file in this entire skill allowed
to name a service.

Every module above `adapter.py` (`ledger.py`, `packer.py`, `remote_cli.py`)
stays deliberately blind to what backend, if any, is behind a given worker.
This module is where that blindness ends: it is the one place permitted to
say "Kaggle", to spawn the one child that speaks to it, and to know that
service's own vocabulary well enough to translate it into the seam's.

Two structural guarantees hold everywhere below, not by convention but by
what this file's own dependency graph can even reach:

1. This module imports `subprocess`, `json`, `csv`, `io`, `re`, `sys`, `os`,
   `dataclasses`, `pathlib` and this skill's own `adapter.py` — nothing
   else. It has no constant, no argument and no configuration key naming
   the credential file `kaggle-accounts` keeps for itself, and it never
   constructs a path into that skill's own data directory. Worker identity
   comes from exactly one sanctioned command, run as a subprocess:
   `python3 <kaggle-accounts>/scripts/accounts_cli.py list --json`, which
   answers with usernames and nothing else (`cmd_list` under `--json`
   builds a fresh dict holding only `username` per account — no other key
   can reach a caller even by accident). This module never imports that
   script; it only runs it, exactly the way a human at a terminal would.

2. A credential VALUE is read at exactly one expression, here, and
   reaches exactly one child process's own environment. `CredentialHandle`
   below is the only credential type this adapter accepts; it carries a
   path, and `_env_for()` — the single sink in the whole file — reads the
   file that path names and puts its stripped content on
   `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN`.

   This is a TRADE, not a preserved invariant, and the old by-path claim
   is retracted rather than reworded: the installed client's
   `_try_fill_auth()` reads `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` and hands it straight to
   `BearerAuth(api_token)`, by value, with no path check of any kind, so a
   path in that variable becomes the literal text of an
   `Authorization: Bearer` header and authenticates nothing. The legacy
   `KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR`/`kaggle.json` shape is not an escape either — it
   routes an access token through a Basic-auth path it was never meant for
   and answers 401 for every account regardless of validity.

   What genuinely holds, and is locked by tests rather than stated here:
   `.token_path` is touched in no module above this one, so no credential
   value has any route into `credentials.py`, `remote_cli.py`, `ledger.py`,
   `packer.py` or `jobfolder.py`; the value is never logged, never
   interpolated into a refusal, and never returned upward; and a file that
   cannot be read, or that holds nothing once stripped, is refused instead
   of sent. See `SKILL.md`'s credential-transport table for the full list
   and the test that proves each row.

Every subprocess call here is `shell=False` with a list argv, an explicit
timeout, and an env built from an allowlist (`PATH` plus, when a credential
is involved, `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` — nothing else is ever forwarded from this
process's own environment). A non-zero exit or an expired timeout is a
refusal: this module raises `KaggleAdapterError` rather than fabricate a
`Status`, a `Submission` or a `Fetched` result the service never actually
confirmed.

This module imports no packaged client and names none — a lock refuses even
the mention, so an edit that inlined one would fail rather than quietly
empty a recorder. The one file permitted that import is
`kaggle_driver.py`, which this module spawns as a child through
`sys.executable`, so the child runs whatever interpreter runs the skill.
Whether that interpreter can import the client is answered by the driver's
own `selftest`, not by a version stated here and enforced nowhere:

    what either one means, only that they exist and where to write them.

    The field set below maps onto `ApiSaveKernelRequest` through

    module never builds that request type itself — that stays the driver's
    own job, the one file permitted to import the packaged client):

    - `machine_shape` — `KAGGLE_MACHINE_SHAPE` (`"NvidiaTeslaT4"`), sent on
      EVERY push. A prior version of this adapter emitted this key against
      the retired `kaggle==1.7.4.5` client, whose `kernels_push()` built its
      request field by field and never read `machine_shape` at all — that
      key silently reached nobody, and every push this skill made before
      that was noticed ran wherever the service's own default draw landed.
      PROVEN LIVE against the current dependency (see
      `KAGGLE_MACHINE_SHAPE`'s own comment above): a kernel pushed with this
      field reached a Tesla T4 and completed.
    - `enable_gpu` — kept alongside `machine_shape`, not in place of it: the
      service's own request shape documents `enable_gpu`/`enable_tpu` as
      DEPRECATED in favor of `machine_shape`, but a reader unfamiliar with
      the newer field still expects to see this one, and sending both costs
      nothing extra.

      This is where the honesty about scope belongs: emitting the fields
      the client reads is a request, and a request is not a receipt. No
      offline test can prove a submission actually received a T4. The
      receipt arrives with the first real run, in `Status.detail` — which
      is what that field is for.
    - `enable_internet` — `True`. The generated runner does `git init` /
      `remote add` / `fetch` inside the kernel to reach the pinned commit,
      and Kaggle kernels have internet access disabled by default; without
      this the clone fails at runtime, after the push already succeeded.
    - `language`/`kernel_type` — `"python"`/`"notebook"`: the runner this
      skill generates is always a `.ipynb` file of Python cells.
    - `is_private` — `True`, a deliberate default this brief left
      unspecified: nothing about a submitted training run should default
      to public.
    - `id` and `code_file` — present, but deliberately BLANK. `id` is
      `<owner>/<kernel-slug>`; it names the account, and no worker is
      assigned yet at `generate-job` time — the packer only assigns one at
      submit time, and the very same job folder pushed to five accounts
      needs five different `id` values. `code_file` names the entrypoint
      file relative to this folder, which this function has no path to
      either (`run_config` carries no notebook path). Both are completed
      by `KaggleAdapter.submit()` below, in a STAGED COPY of the job
      folder — never by mutating this versioned file in place.
    - `title` — derived from `run_config`'s own `jobName`, when present,
      so the pushed kernel is identifiable; padded to satisfy the client's
      own five-character minimum.

    `run_config` is read only for `jobName`, with a fallback when absent

        permitted to split, so nothing above this seam can build a full
        mapping up front for that command. That caller passes a callable,
        resolved lazily the first time a worker is actually needed.

        carrying, credential-shaped or not.

        `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` carries the token's VALUE, and this is the one
        expression in this skill that ever reads one. Measured, not
        assumed: the installed client's own `_try_fill_auth()` reads that
        variable and hands it straight to `BearerAuth(api_token)` — by
        value, with no path check of any kind — so a path here becomes
        the literal text of an `Authorization: Bearer` header and
        authenticates nothing. The legacy `KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR`/`kaggle.json`

        one touches `token_path` at all, and the value is never logged,
        never interpolated into a message, and never returned upward.

        `.strip()` is load-bearing: the credential file ends with the
        newline `materialize` writes, and a newline inside a bearer header
        is a malformed header rather than a credential. A file that cannot
        be read, or that holds nothing once stripped, is refused here —
        the same fail-closed discipline every other unusable answer in this
        module gets, rather than a request sent with a header the service

    def submit(self, job: "ADAPTER.Job") -> "ADAPTER.Submission":
        """Push a kernel version and report back the ref this adapter will
        recognize it by later.

        The submission id is `<worker>/<slug>`, never read out of anything
        the `kaggle` process printed. `poll()`, `fetch()` and
        `list_active()` all recover `worker` from this same id, by
        splitting on the one `/` this construction guarantees is there.

        The slug itself has two different sources depending on shape, and
        conflating them was a real bug this docstring now exists to
        prevent reintroducing: for a GENERATED job folder (metadata file
        present), the slug is derived from the metadata's own `title` —
        confirmed against a real Kaggle account that a newly-created
        kernel's actual slug is the one the service derives from `title`,
        not from the `id` field this method sends it. That one is a LIVE
        observation and was not re-verified against the installed client,
        because it cannot be: the client only warns when `id`'s slug and
        `slugify(title)` disagree, and what the service does with the two
        is not visible in its source. It is recorded here as observed, not
        as read. `job.entrypoint`'s
        own filename is `runner.ipynb` for every generated job
        (`jobfolder.py`'s `RUNNER_FILENAME` constant), so deriving the
        slug from it instead — as this method used to — made every
        job-folder submission to the same worker collide on the identical
        ref `<worker>/runner`, silently overwriting one job's kernel with
        the next one pushed. For the LEGACY shape (no metadata file), the
        entrypoint genuinely does name one notebook per file, so its own
        filename remains the right source there.

        A non-empty `job.run_config` marks a generated job — one whose
        directory `jobfolder.py` was supposed to have written
        `assemble_metadata()`'s output into. This method refuses, before
        ever calling `kernels push`, when that metadata file is absent:
        pushing a folder the service will reject on its own is worse than
        refusing here. An empty `run_config` is the legacy shape and is
        never checked — it behaves exactly as it did before this refusal
        existed.

        The metadata file's own PRESENCE, not `job.run_config`, is what
        decides whether this method completes and stages it: `cmd_submit`
        only ever sets `run_config["mode"] = "smoke"` for a smoke run, so
        an ordinary (non-smoke) job-folder submission carries an EMPTY
        `run_config` exactly like the legacy shape does. `id` names an
        account, which is only known here at submit time — the same
        versioned job folder pushed to five different workers needs five
        different `id` values, and a static file written once at
        `generate-job` time cannot hold that. So when the metadata file is
        present, this method reads the template `assemble_metadata()`
        wrote, fills in `id` (`<worker>/<slug>`) and `code_file`
        (`job.entrypoint`'s own basename — known here, never guessed at by
        `assemble_metadata()`, which has no path to it), and writes the
        completed file into a STAGED COPY of the job folder in a temp
        directory — `kernels push -p <staged dir>` runs against that copy.
        The versioned `kernel-metadata.json` inside the job folder itself
        is read, never opened for writing, and stays byte-for-byte
        unchanged: nothing here mutates a committed artifact per worker.

        `kernels push` uploads `code_file` alone — re-verified by reading
        `kernels_push()` in the installed `kaggle` 1.7.4.5, there is no
        directory upload, so a job folder's own sibling `run-config.json`
        never reaches the worker on its own. This same staging step also
        prepends a cell to the STAGED notebook copy that materializes that
        file back onto disk before the runner's own first cell ever reads
        it (`_stage_run_config_cell()`), whenever `run-config.json` is
        present beside the entrypoint — it always is for a real generated
        job, written by `jobfolder.generate_job()` before the metadata
        file. Its absence (a synthetic job folder carrying only a
        metadata file, as several of this module's own narrower tests
        build) is not treated as an error here: there is nothing to
        materialize, so nothing is injected — a silent no-op rather than
        a refusal, since it changes nothing the caller asked for.

        The staged bytes are the FILE's own content merged with
        `job.run_config`, never the file verbatim on its own. The file was
        made authoritative by a prior fix (`kernels push` uploads only
        `code_file`, so the versioned `run-config.json` had to be injected
        as a cell), and that same stroke silently orphaned every
        submission-time mutation of `job.run_config` — `submit --smoke`
        sets `run_config["mode"] = "smoke"` on the in-memory `Job`, but
        `select_block()` in the pushed kernel only ever saw the file's own
        `mode`-less content, so a `--smoke` submission always ran the
        normal `run` block. The merge rule: when `job.run_config` is
        empty — the legacy shape, and also the ordinary (non-smoke)
        job-folder shape `cmd_submit` produces — the file's own bytes are
        read and staged completely unread otherwise, exactly as before
        this fix; no `json.loads`/`json.dumps` round-trip ever touches
        them, so this path stays byte-identical to today's behavior by
        construction, not by coincidence of formatting. Only when
        `job.run_config` is non-empty is the file parsed, shallow-updated
        at the TOP LEVEL with `dict(job.run_config)` (so `job.run_config`
        wins on a key collision), and re-serialized. Shallow/top-level is
        the deliberate choice, not an oversight: every override this seam
        has ever needed to express — `mode` — is itself a top-level key,
        and `job.run_config` is normalized to an opaque, flat mapping by
        `adapter.py`'s own `Job.__post_init__`; nothing upstream of this
        adapter ever constructs a nested override. This rule does NOT
        cover replacing a single nested field (say, one key inside the
        file's own `run.smoke` block) without clobbering the rest of that
        block — a caller needing that would have to pass the whole nested
        value, since a top-level key present in `job.run_config` replaces
        the file's value for that key entirely rather than merging into
        it.

        Both branches now stage into the SAME temporary copy and always
        complete a `kernel-metadata.json` there, even for the LEGACY
        shape: `_push()` shells out to `kaggle_driver.py` unconditionally
        now, and that driver's own request-mapping step
        (`_save_kernel_request_from_staging`) always reads one from the
        staging directory — Decision 4's table has nothing else to build
        an `ApiSaveKernelRequest` from. A legacy job folder that genuinely
        carries none gets a minimal template synthesized here, in the
        staged copy only; the job folder itself still never needs to
        carry one, exactly as before.

        `machine_shape` is force-set onto the staged template with
        `setdefault`, immediately before `id`/`code_file` are filled in —
        ABSENT-key-only, never value-only: a GENERATED job folder whose
        `kernel-metadata.json` predates this (`assemble_metadata()` did
        not yet write the key) is the one shape that otherwise reaches
        `kernels push` with no requested card at all, silently landing on
        whatever the service defaults to. A template that already names
        one — freshly generated, or a target that deliberately asks for a
        different card — is staged exactly as read.

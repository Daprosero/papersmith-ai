"""The Kaggle SDK driver — the ONLY file in this entire skill allowed to
import `kagglesdk`.

`adapters/kaggle.py` shells out to this script as a child process, exactly
the way it used to shell out to the `kaggle` command-line tool. What moved
is the CHILD's identity, not the boundary: `_env_for()` in `kaggle.py` still
builds one child process's whole environment from an allowlist and puts the
stored account's credential value on it there; this file never reads that
variable itself and never constructs one of its own — the only route to
that value is `kagglesdk`'s own `_try_fill_auth()`, reading the child's
environment on its own, inside `_init_session()`, well after this process
starts.

The installed client's own `authenticate()` demands a classic key or a
`kaggle.json` and performs Basic auth before any request is built; the
stored accounts hold 37-character access tokens that answer Basic with 401
for every account, valid or not. `kagglesdk`'s own `_try_fill_auth()`
prefers a Bearer credential sourced from the child's environment over that
Basic fallback — a route Kaggle's own developers document as unfinished
(`kagglesdk/kaggle_http_client.py:14-17`: "This was created from
kaggle_api_client.py, prior to recent changes to auth handling. The new
client requires KAGGLE_API_TOKEN, so it is not currently usable by the
CLI."). Driving that route directly is the entire reason this file exists.

The child-process boundary is preserved deliberately, not incidentally:
`KaggleHttpClient.__init__` takes no credential argument at all, so the
only public way to hand it one is that process-global environment variable
— two concurrent workers sharing one process would race it. One process
per submission is what makes concurrent credentials correct, and it is the
exact same boundary that keeps an argv/env observation point alive for this
skill's own offline proof. See `SKILL.md`'s credential-transport table for
the guarantees this preserves and the ones a second interception point,
mounted on this driver's own `requests` session in its tests, exists to
prove instead (what a submission's outbound request actually contains).

The one client this file ever builds is constructed at exactly one
expression (`_build_client()`, below) — the same idiom
`CredentialSecurityTests` already locks `adapters/kaggle.py` to for
`.token_path`. Every operation function below receives that already-built
client rather than constructing its own; a function that built one anyway
would bypass whatever transport a caller (this file's own test suite
included) mounted on the shared session and attempt a real socket.

Run with the interpreter that has this package installed — measured on
this machine to be the interpreter the CommandLineTools ship,
`sys.executable` in the invoking (adapter) process, since that is the one
process the whole call chain already inherits from. `selftest` is the
first thing a caller should run: it reports whether the interpreter
running this file has a `kagglesdk` that both imports AND can name an
accelerator, and if either is untrue, the refusal names that interpreter
and the install command by which it becomes true, rather than a bare
traceback.

Both halves of that question are asked at module level, not in the
`selftest` branch, so `submit`, `poll`, `fetch` and `capacity` are refused
under a bad interpreter too — `selftest` is the recommended first call,
never the only gate. See `_accelerator_capability_error()` for why the
second half is a `hasattr` against the real request class rather than a
version comparison.

    alternative route: `download_kernel_output` (a THIRD download RPC,
    distinct from both `list_kernel_session_output` above and

    whose owner-naming field is `owner_slug`, not `user_name` — leaving it
    unset answers 403 Forbidden, not a field-shaped error, and its response
    is an `HttpRedirect` requiring a SECOND fetch of `redirect.url`. This
    function never constructs that request type at all, so neither trap
    applies here: `ApiListKernelSessionOutputRequest.user_name` above is the
    correct field for the RPC this function actually calls, not a mistaken
    echo of `download_kernel_output`'s own `owner_slug`.
    either side.

    OPEN QUESTION, named here rather than guessed at (see the design's own
    Open Questions and this repository's tasks for Phase 3): whether those
    per-file `url`s need THIS session's own Bearer credential, or answer to
    an anonymous GET, is settled only by a live rehearsal against a real
    account — not run by this commit, not run by this file, ever, without
    the user's explicit permission. This function makes the DEFENSIVE
    choice instead of picking a side: it downloads through
    `client._client._session` — the exact same already-authenticated
    `requests.Session` the `list_kernel_session_output` call just above
    used — so `requests`' own `session.auth` hook attaches the identical
    `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to every per-file GET too,
    without this function constructing a second auth mechanism of its own.
    If a URL needs no such header, an extra one that the URL's own host
    simply ignores costs nothing; if a URL DOES need it, omitting it would
    be a silent, wrong download disguised as a successful one — the costlier
    of the two wrong guesses this open question names, and the one this
    choice avoids. Doctrine (`SKILL.md`'s credential-transport table,
    rewritten in a later commit) must record this row as
    `unverified-by-rehearsal` rather than a settled guarantee.

    `client._client._session` reaches into two attributes the SDK marks
    private (`KernelsApiClient._client`, `KaggleHttpClient._session`)
    because `kagglesdk` exposes no public accessor for the session a raw
    per-file URL must be fetched through — `download_kernel_output`/
    `download_kernel_output_zip` are RPC calls returning a redirect or a
    typed file download, neither of which is the shape
    `list_kernel_session_output` itself already returns. There is no route
    to these URLs through this SDK's own public surface.

    Never relies on the driver's own reported file names for anything but
    what to write to disk; a file entry missing a name or url refuses
    rather than guessing at either.

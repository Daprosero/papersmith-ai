"""The capacity clamp: what a repository asks for, clamped to what a worker allows.

The settled rule this module exists to enforce, and enforce in exactly one
place: the adapter states the cap, the repository states the request, and
this module — never either of those two — does the clamping. Neither side
is trusted to know the other's fact. How many jobs a worker will run at
once is a fact about the service, so it is read here only through
`adapter.workers()`, never accepted as a parameter from a caller and never
hardcoded. How many the repository WANTS to use of that is the repository's
own declared intent, handed in as `requested` by whoever calls `plan()` —
this module never guesses it and never defaults it.

`plan()` reports `requested`, `cap`, `inFlight` and `granted` as four
separate numbers on purpose. A clamp collapsed down to `granted` alone is
indistinguishable from an unclamped grant that merely happens to equal the
same number — a caller asking for five and receiving two because the
service caps at two looks identical, from `granted` alone, to a caller
asking for exactly two and receiving it. Those are different facts to know
before spending an afternoon waiting on a service, and this module keeps
them different by never collapsing them into one number in the first place.

Three functions read that one clamp at three different scopes, never a
fourth kind of number invented for any of them. `plan()` answers for ONE
named worker — a fact about that worker alone. `select()` walks every
worker `adapter.workers()` reports, in that same declared order, and
returns the first one whose health can be established and that still has
room; it stops at the first healthy account, a one-account probe.
`distribute()` walks every worker too, but never stops early: it reads
`plan()` for each one, sums what every healthy account actually grants
into one total, and spreads a caller's own opaque work units across that
total round-robin. One worker's clamp — `select()`'s whole concern — is
one case among many `distribute()` reads the exact same way, never a
special one it treats differently.

Depends only on `adapter.py`'s ABC (`plan()` requires a real `Adapter`
instance, checked structurally, not merely documented) and `ledger.py`'s
`fold()` (to learn what is already in flight before granting more). Names
no backend and holds no service-specific knowledge; nothing below this
module's own two dependencies is ever imported.

    question: "spread ALL of these units across every account that has

    from `adapter.workers()`, unit order from the caller — and it inspects

    caller's knowledge, never this module's.

    No `requested` parameter: every worker is asked `requested=len(units)`
    and `plan()` (via `_triage()`) does the clamping, exactly once per
    worker. Pre-slicing `len(units) // len(workers)` before asking is
    REJECTED — three units over five workers would floor to a zero-sized
    ask at every worker and distribute nothing at all, the same collapse

    same function — a unit left `unplaced` becomes assignable again only on

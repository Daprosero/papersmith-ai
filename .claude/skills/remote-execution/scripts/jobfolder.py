"""Generate a forge-owned, service-blind job folder for a target repository.

`generate_job()` is the whole of `generate-job` (driven by `remote_cli.py`,
which loads this module the same sibling way it loads `ledger.py`,
`packer.py` and `adapter.py`). It builds `<target>/tools/<service>/
<job-name>/`: `runner.ipynb`, `run-config.json`, and one adapter-supplied
metadata file — writing the metadata file's bytes and filename opaquely, as
returned by `ADAPTER.resolve_metadata(service)`, without ever learning what
either one means (see `adapter.py`'s own docstring on that registry).

`--target` is resolved first, and every path this module touches —
`resolve_destination()`'s containment check, the `.partial/` build
directory, the final rename — is derived from that resolved value, never
from the raw argument. Generation refuses when the derived destination is
not a directory inside the resolved target, which is what stands between a
crafted `--service`/`--job-name` (`../../etc`, say) and a write outside the
target repository entirely.

`verify_pin_preconditions()` runs next, before `resolve_clone_paths()` or
any write. It is the ONE home for every condition a pin must satisfy
before anything irreversible happens, and the only thing either decision
point calls — `generate-job` here, and `remote_cli.py`'s `submit` — with
exactly one word different between them: the `decision` that appears in
the refusal. Conditions run in `PIN_CONDITIONS` order, cheapest first,
and the first failure raises. Two call sites and three conditions could
otherwise drift in order, or omit one on one side, with nothing in the
code to say so.

Condition (1), `clean-worktree`, is `git status --porcelain` over the
declared clone paths, and `git diff` would be the wrong instrument rather
than a slower one: `diff` enumerates changes to TRACKED content, so an
untracked path is outside its domain by construction. That is the exact
case this condition exists to catch, because `resolve_clone_paths()`
below walks the WORKING TREE: a brand-new module that was never `git
add`ed passes the import walk and is simply absent from the commit the
runner clones, and the job dies in the kernel with `ModuleNotFoundError`
after quota is spent. Nothing here stages, commits, stashes or fetches on
the operator's behalf, and there is deliberately no flag that accepts a
dirty tree.

Condition (3), `pin-published`, is `_verify_commit_reachable()`, before
any write: `--commit` proving out with `git cat-file -e` only shows the pin
exists in the LOCAL checkout that ran `generate-job` — it says nothing
about whether the declared `--repo-url` can actually serve it, which is
what a runner needs when it clones that remote and checks out the
pin inside the kernel. `git ls-remote <repo-url> <commit>` cannot answer
this for a bare commit SHA (`ls-remote` matches ref *names*; a 40-hex pin
that is not literally a branch/tag name comes back empty with exit 0
either way), so this uses the accurate equivalent instead: `git fetch
--dry-run --depth 1 <repo-url> <commit>`, which the remote's own
upload-pack either serves or refuses with "not our ref".

That fetch is issued from a scratch repository made for it and thrown
away after — never from the target. Every sentence above was true of the
first version of this check and it still could not fire, because it asked
from inside the target: a repository holding the pin answers the `want`
out of its own object store without the remote's upload-pack being
consulted at all, and the repository the operator just committed in
always holds the pin. The depth matches the runner's own fetch
(`assets/runner_bootstrap.py:169`); `--dry-run` suppresses ref updates
but NOT object transfer, so a probe run in the target would also deposit
the remote's whole shallow tree there on every generation — 12.8 MiB of
it, measured, for the repository this skill targets.

Fails closed exactly like `computedNotDeclared`, never a warning, and
closed on an unanswerable network failure too: an unresolved DNS lookup
cannot confirm reachability any more than it can deny it, and generation
is local and free to re-run, so "cannot determine" refuses exactly like
"confirmed absent" rather than risking a silent pass on the one path this
check exists to close.

`resolve_clone_paths()` is the AST-based, transitive dependency check:
declared `clonePaths` are cross-checked against what the declared entry
modules (`run.module`, plus `run.smoke.module` when present) actually
import, transitively, before a job folder is ever written. A real import
missing from `clonePaths` (`computedNotDeclared`) always refuses
generation; an import this walk cannot resolve with confidence (a
non-literal `importlib.import_module(...)` call, any `__import__(...)`
call, a `sys.path` mutation, an unparsable file, or an import that looks
like this repository's own code but does not resolve to a file on disk)
also refuses, unless `--accept-unresolved` is passed — which records the
uncertainty in `run-config.json`'s `unresolvedImports` instead of silently
guessing. See `resolve_clone_paths()`'s own docstring for the full rule.

    RECLASSIFICATION using the write signal, never silent exclusion: a
    write call site was already never a read candidate (Decision 5,
    unchanged); collecting it here additionally does not remove or
    silence anything on its own — `resolve_clone_paths()` still surfaces
    every produced-file candidate, and `generate_job()` still refuses it

    modules actually import, transitively, before generation ever writes a

    Reuses `implementation_cli.py`'s `prior_work_state()` idiom exactly for
    the walk itself (`ast.parse` + `ast.walk` over `ast.Import`/
    `ast.ImportFrom`, inspecting only `node.module` for `ImportFrom` and
    `alias.name` for `Import`, with no relative-import resolution) — just
    walked transitively, over every module an entry module reaches,
    instead of over one fixed file set.

    One conservative widening on top of that reused idiom, confirmed
    necessary by a real production gap: for `from A import name`, `name`
    is also tried as a candidate submodule `A.name`, and enqueued ONLY
    when that candidate resolves to an actual file on disk. Without this,
    `from A import sub` enqueues `A` alone, which resolves to
    `A/__init__.py` — never to `A/sub.py` when `sub` is a submodule FILE
    rather than an attribute `__init__.py` itself defines, so `sub.py`'s
    own imports were never walked at all. A generated job's `from
    PackageName import alpha, beta, gamma, delta` (an empty `__init__.py`)
    let `delta.py`'s own further import slip past this check undeclared,
    and a real clone failed at runtime with `ModuleNotFoundError` for
    exactly that reason. Resolving the
    candidate first, rather than enqueuing every imported name
    unconditionally, is what keeps an ordinary `from A import
    some_attribute` from becoming a spurious `unresolved` entry.

    The granularity rule (design #744 section 3): a resolved import maps
    to its top-level package directory under `src/`, never to a single
    file — `src/A/B/C.py` => clone path `src/A`; a true top-level module
    `src/A.py` => clone path `src/A.py`. An import that is not this
    repository's own code (its top-level segment names nothing under
    `<target>/src` at all) is filtered and never becomes a clone path.

    Returns `{"declared", "computed", "computedNotDeclared", "unresolved",
    "computedReadsNotDeclared", "producedReadsNotDeclared",
    "unresolvedReads"}`:
    `declared` is `declared_clone_paths` re-validated through the SAME
    `validate_clone_paths()` `generate_job()` already uses (structural,
    plus the symlink-escape check now that `target` is known) — never a
    second validator. `computedNotDeclared` names every real import missing
    from `clonePaths`; a non-empty result is always a refusal, never a
    warning. `unresolved` names every uncertain case this walk hit: a
    non-literal `importlib.import_module(...)` call, any `__import__(...)`
    call, a `sys.path` mutation, an unparsable file, or an import that
    looks like this repository's own code but does not resolve to a file
    on disk. A non-empty `unresolved` refuses generation unless the caller
    passes `--accept-unresolved`, which records it in `run-config.json`'s
    `unresolvedImports` instead of guessing.

    `computedReadsNotDeclared`, `producedReadsNotDeclared`, and
    `unresolvedReads` (Unit 1, undeclared-read detection; the corrective
    batch adds `producedReadsNotDeclared`) are built from the SAME parsed
    `tree` this walk already holds for every transitively-reached file —
    no new file traversal. `_fold_module_constants()` builds each file's
    own constant->`Path` table; `_scan_read_call_sites()` classifies every
    call site against the read/write/neutral roster, now ALSO returning
    every folded, target-contained path targeted by a WRITE call site
    anywhere in the walked file set (`write_candidates`).

    A folded, target-contained read whose resolved path is not covered by
    a declared clone path (`Path.is_relative_to`, never exact-match-only)
    is always a refusal, never a warning — but WHICH of two buckets it
    refuses through now depends on the write signal (corrective batch,
    reclassification, not suppression — see `SKILL.md`'s
    "generation-deadlock" doctrine for the full account):

    - not written anywhere in the same walked file set ->
      `computedReadsNotDeclared`: a genuinely missing declared input,
      refused UNCONDITIONALLY, no hatch, unchanged from before this
      corrective batch;
    - ALSO written somewhere in the same walked file set (the same
      resolved path appears as a WRITE call-site target, e.g.
      `RECORD.write_text(...)` beside `RECORD.read_text()`) ->
      `producedReadsNotDeclared`: a produced-file candidate — the job may
      exist to CREATE this file on its first run, so declaring it (as
      `_refuse_absent_clone_paths` would then require existing at the
      pin) is not always possible. Refused unless the caller passes
      `--accept-produced-reads`, which records the finding VERBATIM in
      `run-config.json`'s `acceptedProducedReads` — the operator is still
      told and still decides; nothing disappears silently.

    A read call site whose path could not be folded, or a folded,
    target-contained path used in a call this walk cannot classify,
    becomes an `unresolvedReads` entry instead — refused unless the
    caller passes `--accept-unresolved-reads`, a SEPARATE flag from
    `--accept-unresolved` (imports) and from `--accept-produced-reads`
    that never waives either other refusal (severity asymmetry: an
    accepted uncertain import dies loudly in the kernel minutes later; an
    accepted uncertain read is reported by nobody). A path outside
    `target` is dropped from candidacy entirely, never flagged — the same
    `external` posture `_classify_import()` gives a non-local import.
    All three new keys are always present, even when empty (never
    absent).

    staleness condition is explicitly out of scope for this skill.

    `unresolved_imports`, when non-empty, is recorded verbatim as
    `unresolvedImports` — the `--accept-unresolved` escape hatch turning a
    silence into a recorded, reportable decision (design #744 section 3).

    `unresolved_reads`, when non-empty, is recorded verbatim as
    `unresolvedReads` — the SAME omit-when-empty convention as
    `unresolvedImports`, but gated by the SEPARATE `--accept-unresolved-reads`
    flag (Unit 1, undeclared-read detection). A job folder generated
    before this field existed simply omits it; `validate_run_config()`
    checks required fields with no key allowlist, so absence never
    invalidates an existing job folder.

    `accepted_produced_reads`, when non-empty, is recorded verbatim as
    `acceptedProducedReads` (corrective batch) — the SAME omit-when-empty
    convention, gated by the SEPARATE `--accept-produced-reads` flag. A
    produced-read finding is a read of a path the same walked file set
    also writes (the job may exist to CREATE it on its first run); the
    flag turns the silence into a recorded, reportable decision the same
    way `--accept-unresolved`/`--accept-unresolved-reads` already do —
    this is RECLASSIFICATION with a recorded acceptance, never a silent
    exclusion: the operator is still told, and still has to decide.

    `smoke_required_evidence`, when given, is recorded verbatim as
    `run.smoke.requiredEvidence` — the dot-separated field paths
    `shard_io.completeness()` will later walk to judge a smoke run's own
    returned stamp. This module never learns what any of those paths
    MEAN; it only carries the list from the target's own declaration (a
    repeatable `--smoke-required-evidence` CLI flag) to wherever `smoke
    record` reads it back from — the SAME "caller brings the vocabulary"
    discipline `completeness(stamp, required)` already holds in
    `shard_io.py`. Given without also declaring a smoke block, it is
    refused: a required-evidence list with no smoke run to judge is not a
    value this schema can express.

    `accelerator_kind`/`accelerator_architectures`, when given, are
    recorded verbatim as `accelerator: {kind, architectures[]}`. This
    module names only those two fields and never a value: an architecture
    list, never a device name, because a name answers *is this the card I
    named* (a device's own name string is not even stable across how many
    units share it) while an architecture list answers *can this build
    run here* — the question `runner_bootstrap.py`'s accelerator gate
    actually asks, against the torch build installed at run time. Omitted
    entirely, no `accelerator` block is written and the generated job
    behaves exactly as it did before this field existed (additive,
    `schemaVersion` stays 1). Given partially — a kind with no
    architecture list, or the reverse — is refused: neither half alone is
    a value this schema can express.

    `environment_requirements`/`environment_index_url`, when given, are
    recorded verbatim as `environment: {install: {requirements[],
    indexUrl}}` (Decision 3). This module names only those two fields
    and never a package: it does not know which tensor-library build a
    target needs, only that the target declared one. `indexUrl` is
    optional within a declared install — a caller relying on pip's own
    default index declares `requirements` alone — but declaring
    `indexUrl` with no `requirements` is refused: an index with nothing
    to install is not a value this schema can express. Omitted entirely,
    no `environment` block is written and the generated job behaves
    exactly as it did before this field existed (additive, `schemaVersion`
    stays 1). Specifier-shape validation (a requirement beginning with
    `-` is refused) happens where the install actually runs —
    `runner_bootstrap.py`'s `install_environment()` — not here: this
    module only carries the target's own declared list.

    existing one unless `regenerate=True`.

    `commit` may be omitted, and then defaults to the target's HEAD
    through `_resolve_pin()` — one implementation shared with the CLI, so
    the two cannot disagree about what HEAD means, and a purely local one
    that reaches no remote. The default is not independent of the
    conditions below: HEAD is the code that was validated precisely
    because condition (1) proves the working tree holds the same bytes and
    condition (2) proves the pin is that commit. Resolution happens BEFORE
    them, and a defaulted pin then meets every condition exactly as an
    explicit one does. An explicit `commit` is never substituted,
    discovered or overridden.

    Order is fixed: resolve `target` (no other check runs against a raw,
    unresolved path); derive and validate `destination`; resolve the pin;
    put it
    through every condition in `PIN_CONDITIONS`, in that order, via the
    single shared `verify_pin_preconditions()` — which is also the only
    thing `submit` calls, so the two decision points cannot drift in
    order or in which conditions they enforce — refusing before anything
    else runs if any of them fails; resolve and cross-check
    `clone_paths` against what the declared entry modules actually import
    (`resolve_clone_paths()`), refusing before anything else is built if
    that check fails; build `run-config.json` and the
    notebook fully, in memory, before touching disk; only then check for an
    existing folder or a leftover `.partial/`. Everything from that point
    on writes into `<job>.partial/` first — `run-config.json`,
    `runner.ipynb`, and the adapter-supplied metadata file, in that order —
    and only a fully-written `.partial/` is ever renamed into place. A
    half-written job folder therefore cannot exist: either `.partial/`
    never became `destination` at all, or it did so as one atomic rename
    with everything already inside it.

    Regeneration replaces the existing folder without ever leaving
    `destination` half-old-half-new: the existing folder is renamed aside
    (an atomic rename to a fresh, guaranteed-unused name) before the new
    `.partial/` is renamed into `destination`'s place, and only removed
    once that second rename has actually succeeded. If the second rename
    itself fails, the aside copy is renamed straight back — `destination`
    is either the old job folder or the new one at every instant an
    outside observer could look, never neither and never a mix.

    `accelerator_kind`/`accelerator_architectures`, when BOTH omitted (the
    from-zero case), are resolved from `service`'s own registered default
    via `ADAPTER.resolve_default_accelerator()` — service knowledge,
    read the same way `ADAPTER.resolve_metadata()` is a few lines below,
    never a value this module invents or hardcodes itself. A caller
    supplying either half explicitly always wins outright; a service
    that registered no default (or registered none at all) leaves the
    generated job with no `accelerator` block, exactly as every job did
    before this default existed — silence, not a guess.
    `environment_requirements`/`environment_index_url` carry no such
    default: an install is TARGET knowledge (which packages a specific
    repository needs), never service knowledge, so this function only
    ever forwards what a caller explicitly declared.

    — the exact operation a runner performs when it clones that remote and

    writes a byte.

    **The probe runs in a scratch repository, never in the target, and
    that is the whole of this function's correctness.** A repository that
    already holds the pin is the one place on earth that cannot ask this
    question: git answers a `want` it can satisfy locally without the
    remote's `upload-pack` ever being consulted. Since generation is run
    from the repository the operator just committed in, the target always
    holds the pin, so a probe run there returned clean for every pin
    anyone could write — including one committed a second ago and never
    pushed, which is precisely and only the case this check exists for.
    So: `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` → `git init -q` → fetch, and the
    directory is discarded on the way out.

    Two consequences that are easy to get backwards, both measured
    against the live remote this skill targets rather than reasoned about:

    * `--dry-run` suppresses ref updates. It does NOT suppress object
      transfer. One shallow probe wrote 12.8 MiB of objects into the
      repository it ran in while writing no ref and no `FETCH_HEAD` at
      all. Running it in the target would therefore grow the operator's
      object store by the remote's whole shallow tree on every single
      generation — a second, quieter reason the scratch directory is not
      merely a way of getting the right answer.
    * `--depth 1` is what `assets/runner_bootstrap.py:169` fetches at, so
      matching it is what makes "the probe is the operation the runner
      performs" true. It also happens to defeat the local-object-store
      shortcut on its own, because a shallow fetch has to negotiate a
      boundary with the remote — but that is a git implementation detail
      two flags deep, and this function does not lean on it. The scratch
      repository makes the question structurally unanswerable from local
      state; the depth makes it the runner's question. Neither one
      substitutes for the other.
    * The fetch call passes `timeout=PIN_PUBLISHED_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
      explicitly — a THIRD fact measured against the same live remote,
      easy to get backwards in the same way: `_run_git()`'s own default,
      `GIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (120s), is what the `git init -q` call above
      still runs under, because that call is purely local and never
      needed more. The fetch transfers real bytes, and 12.4 MiB on a slow
      connection took 209s once and 27s on an identical re-run of the
      SAME commit. Sharing one budget between the two made the verdict
      track the LINK, not the pin: the slower run reported the commit as
      "not pushed" from transfer time alone. A timeout is "the question
      could not be asked", never "the answer is no", and the two must not
      share one refusal message either — see the two `except` branches
      below.

    `git cat-file -e <pinned>^{commit}` (used by `_staleness_for()` below)
    only proves the pin exists in the target's LOCAL history; it is silent
    on whether `repo_url` can serve it. `git ls-remote <repo_url>
    <commit>` cannot fill that gap either for a bare 40-hex commit SHA:
    `ls-remote` matches ref *names* against a pattern, and a commit hash
    is not a ref name unless it happens to collide with one, so it comes
    back empty with exit 0 whether or not the remote actually has the
    commit — reconfirmed against the live remote while rewriting this,
    not merely inherited from the note that first claimed it. `git fetch
    --dry-run --depth 1 <repo_url> <commit>` is the accurate equivalent:
    the remote's own upload-pack either serves the object graph reaching
    `commit` (exit 0) or refuses it with "not our ref" (non-zero) — the
    same failure a runner's own clone would hit, just paid for here
    instead of inside a kernel after quota is spent. It runs through
    `_run_git()`, the single composition point, so it inherits that
    function's `shell=False` list-argv, `GIT_ENV_ALLOWLIST`,
    `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` and `stdin=DEVNULL` discipline rather than a
    second, parallel one — `repo_url` reaches an outside host and is
    treated as untrusted input the same way a pinned commit already is
    elsewhere in this module.

    The `git init` is inside the same `try` as the fetch, and so is the
    `TemporaryDirectory()` that precedes it. A scratch repository that
    cannot be created is an unanswerable question, and this module has
    one settled answer for those. Leaving either outside would let the
    failure surface as a bare `JobFolderError` — or, for the temporary
    directory, an unhandled `OSError`, which is a crash rather than a
    refusal — naming neither the commit nor the remote the operator has
    to act on.

    `repo_ref` is used for exactly one thing and never for a decision:
    the remedy sentence. The pin is deliberately NOT validated as
    contained in that ref — proving that needs either the ref's whole
    history (the unbounded cost `--depth 1` exists to avoid) or the
    remote's tip alone (false the moment anyone else pushes).

    Raises `JobFolderError` — refusing generation, exactly like the
    existing `computedNotDeclared` refusal, never a warning — both when
    the remote confirms it cannot serve `commit` AND when the question
    could not be asked at all (a DNS failure, a timeout, an unreachable
    host, a scratch repository that could not be made). A network
    failure cannot confirm reachability any more than it can deny it, the
    same way `_staleness_for()`'s own `unknown` verdict is never rendered
    as `fresh`. Generation is local and costs nothing to re-run once
    connectivity is back; a wrong PASS here costs spent remote-execution
    quota and a failure discovered only after the push — the exact
    expense this check exists to avoid. Git's own message (which does
    name the distinct underlying cause) is carried into the refusal
    rather than replaced with a second, coarser one.

    A timeout (`GitTimeoutError`, raised by `_run_git()` for exactly this
    case) is refused through its OWN branch, with its OWN wording, never
    folded into the same message a confirmed "not our ref" or a DNS
    failure produces (Finding 4 case A). A timeout means "the question
    could not be finished asking" — it is silent on which answer the
    remote would have given — and is a categorically different fact from
    "the remote answered no", even though both refuse generation exactly
    the same way. A shared budget once let a slow-but-successful fetch
    time out and get reported with the SAME "could not be confirmed
    reachable ... push it and pin the commit the remote actually
    received" wording a genuine refusal gets: a true measurement (the
    transfer took over 120s) producing a false conclusion (the commit
    must be unpublished), because the timeout and the refusal shared one
    message. `PIN_PUBLISHED_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` narrows how often this
    branch fires at all; this message split is what keeps it honest on
    the rarer occasion a probe still exceeds even that wider budget.

    An SSH-shaped `repo_url` gets a sentence added to that same refusal,
    not a guard of its own. The probe is unauthenticated on purpose, and
    so is the runner, so `Permission denied (publickey)` here is a real
    finding about the job rather than a local accident — but it reads
    like a local accident unless the message says so. Refusing SSH URLs
    on sight instead would be deciding remote policy on the strength of a
    colon in a string, and would refuse a working deploy-key setup.

def _staleness_for(target: Path, pinned_commit: str, clone_paths: Sequence[str]) -> dict:
    """The one staleness condition (design #744 §4), always computed, never
    skippable:

        head    = git rev-parse HEAD
        exists  = git cat-file -e <pinned>^{commit}
        changed = git diff --name-only <pinned> HEAD -- <clonePaths…>

    The pathspec (`-- <clonePaths…>`) does the intersection with the
    declared clone paths — deliberately: there is no second,
    prefix-matching implementation of that intersection anywhere in this
    module that could drift from this one.

    Verdict is `drift` iff `changed` is non-empty. Never a refusal: this
    function always returns a verdict, it never raises for a stale or
    unknown result.

    The SAME verdict refuses at a decision point and only reports at
    `read()`, and that asymmetry is deliberate rather than an accident of
    where the code sits. `_refuse_stale_pin()` — condition (2) in
    `PIN_CONDITIONS` — calls exactly this function and raises on `drift`
    and `unknown`, so `generate-job` and `submit` both refuse. `read()`
    calls it and attaches the verdict. Reading is an observation: refusing
    there would make a drifted job folder unreadable, which is the one
    state in which reading it is most useful, and every reporting command
    (`status`, `fetch`, `reconcile`) would lose the ability to say what is
    wrong. Refusing belongs where something irreversible is about to
    happen; reporting belongs where someone is looking.

    For a long time only the reporting half existed. Two non-gating layers
    consumed the verdict — a line in `submit`'s return payload, and
    `fromStaleSubmission` on the way back — and neither could refuse, so a
    job folder pinned to code that had already moved on was generated,
    submitted and run with the drift printed beside the submission id as
    though it were weather. Condition (2) is the missing consumer. There
    is still exactly one computation, which is what keeps the guard and
    the report from ever disagreeing.

    This function compares two COMMITTED trees and is blind to
    uncommitted work by construction — which is why condition (1)
    (`clean-worktree`) is a separate condition ordered before it, and not
    a refinement of this one.

    `unknown`, with a reason, whenever the question cannot be answered at
    all: no git history, not a repository, or an absent pinned commit —
    reusing `implementation_cli.py`'s own `prior_work_state()` discipline
    of never letting an unanswerable record pass for a clean one.
    `unknown` is never rendered as `fresh`: the two are separate branches
    below, neither one falls back to the other.

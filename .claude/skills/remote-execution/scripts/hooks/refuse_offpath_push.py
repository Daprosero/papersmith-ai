"""A tripwire, not a gate (design §5, `the-position-nobody-holds`): refuses
a `Bash` invocation that mentions a service's own push surface without
ALSO invoking `remote_cli.py`.

The load-bearing precondition is `_verify_launch_authorization()` inside
`submit` itself (`remote_cli.py`) -- it is the ONLY mechanism this change
trusts to keep a full-scale launch honest, because it reads a record no
caller's own argv could have produced. This script covers only the residue
that precondition structurally cannot see: a launch that never calls
`submit` at all, and so never reaches it. This repository has produced
exactly that shape once -- a hand-rolled probe lost `mode=smoke` and ran a
full-scale search on a metered account -- which is the incident this
script exists to catch a repeat of, nothing more.

Reads a `PreToolUse` hook payload for the `Bash` tool from stdin (Claude
Code's own hook contract: a JSON object carrying `tool_name` and
`tool_input`, the latter holding `command` for the `Bash` tool). Exits `2`
with a refusal on stderr when the command names a push surface without
naming `remote_cli.py` anywhere in it; exits `0` silently otherwise,
including when the payload cannot be read at all -- a tripwire that cannot
parse its own input refuses NOTHING, it never fails closed onto an
unrelated command.

Push surfaces are never hardcoded here. Each adapter under
`scripts/adapters/` declares its own module-level `PUSH_SURFACE: tuple[str,
...]` -- `adapters/kaggle.py` is the one place this skill lets a service be
named (its own docstring's confinement rule), and this script only ever
READS that declaration. A second service is covered by that service's own
adapter declaring its own tuple, never by editing this file.

What this predicate explicitly does NOT do: read a job's mode. `mode=smoke`
is a `submit`-time argv flag written into `run_config` on the `Job` object
(`remote_cli.py`'s own `cmd_submit`), never a job-folder property readable
before submission -- a predicate that tried to classify scale from disk
would be unimplementable, and design §5 records this so it is not
re-proposed.

Honest bound, stated rather than implied: `python -c "..."`, a heredoc, or
a script file that itself shells out defeats simple substring matching.
This hook catches the shape that actually happened once and nothing more
-- it is never the reason a launch is safe. That reason is
`_verify_launch_authorization()`, which this script does not replace and
does not need to be trusted as strongly as.

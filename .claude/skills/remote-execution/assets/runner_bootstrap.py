"""Cell 0 of the generated runner notebook — copied byte for byte.

`jobfolder.build_notebook()` copies this file's bytes into the notebook's
first cell with ZERO interpolation. The same bytes serve every job because
every fact this cell needs comes from `run-config.json`, read at runtime,
never baked in at generation time. Ten responsibilities, in order:

1. read `run-config.json`; validate schema/version
2. sparse-clone the pinned commit: `git init`, `remote add`,
   `sparse-checkout set <clonePaths>`, `fetch --depth 1 origin <commit>`,
   `checkout FETCH_HEAD`
3. `sys.path.insert(0, <clone>/src)`
4. install the declared build: `sys.executable -m pip install`, list
   argv, against `run-config.json`'s additive `environment.install`
   (Decision 3). This runs BEFORE responsibility 5, never after —
   responsibility 5 imports the declared modules, and those modules
   import the tensor library this step installs; installing after that
   point would be too late. An older, undeclared config carries no
   `environment.install` block and this step is a no-op. Honest cost:
   this installs on every kernel that runs a job, adding minutes to each
   one — a campaign of thirty shards pays that cost thirty times.
   Determinism (the arriving capability verified against what was
   actually installed, never assumed) was chosen over the cheaper
   deferral of trusting a pre-baked image
5. import each declared module and assert its `__file__` resolves under
   the clone's own `src` — the "pip-installed copy" refusal: a module
   importable from somewhere ELSE already on `sys.path` would silently
   run against code this job never pinned a commit for. A declared
   NOTEBOOK gets the same proof in the only form a notebook can take
   (`verify_notebooks_under_clone`): the file is where the pinned sparse
   checkout should have put it, and it names a kernel
6. detect hardware — `torch` not importable IS "hardware missing"; no
   silent CPU fallback, or this refusal could never actually fire
7. write `bootstrap.json`: commit, config, detected environment, resolved
   imports and resolved notebooks
8. any of config / code / hardware missing raises `SystemExit` on the
   spot, so cell 1 never runs against a half-prepared runtime
9. the notebook-executor gate, when a notebook is declared: `nbformat`,
   `nbclient` and `jupyter_client` must be importable and the notebook's
   own kernel must resolve to an installed kernelspec. Probed, never
   assumed — this cell installs only what the target declared, and the
   remedy a refusal names is that same declaration. Runs AFTER
   responsibility 7 for the same reason the accelerator gate does
10. the accelerator gate: the arriving capability must appear in the
   installed arch list, and any declared `accelerator.architectures`
   must be covered by that same installed list. This runs AFTER
   responsibility 7, never before — a refusal whose evidence was never
   written is unreadable no matter how early it fires, so `bootstrap.json`
   already carries the arriving device, the torch build and the arch
   list the verdict was computed from by the time this refuses
11. no service name anywhere, ever

Importable and independently testable: every responsibility above is a
plain function, and `bootstrap()` composes them. Nothing runs at import
time — the orchestrating call sits behind `if __name__ == "__main__":`,
the state a notebook cell's own top-level code runs in (a Jupyter
kernel's namespace has `__name__ == "__main__"`), so importing this file
under a different module name never fires it. That is what lets the forge
suite drive `bootstrap()` and every helper directly against fake configs,
in-process — the whole justification `jobfolder.py` gives for shipping
this as a byte-for-byte copy rather than a per-job embedded prose cell.

Every git call goes through `_run_git()`, the single composition point:
`shell=False`, list argv, a PATH-only env allowlist, an explicit timeout,
non-zero exit is a refusal.

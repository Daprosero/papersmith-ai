"""Kaggle credentials: prove they work, keep the ones that do, drop the rest.

The user supplies the credentials by hand — a `kaggle.json` downloaded from
Kaggle, or a `.txt`/`.md` list with one `username key` per line, left in the inbox. That
being manual is what this is *for*: the work worth automating is not moving a
file, it is answering **does this account actually authenticate**, which is a
question only Kaggle can answer and one that stops being true over time.

So there are two operations and no more. ``validate`` re-checks every stored
account and takes in whatever is new, keeping only what authenticates.
``remove`` deletes what you no longer want. Everything else — ``list``,
``discover`` — exists to build the choices for those two.

Validating is not a setup step. Tokens get expired and rotated, and an account
that quietly stopped working does not fail when you add it; it fails hours later
in the middle of a run. That is why the stored accounts are re-checked every
time, not just the new ones.

An account is its Kaggle username. There is no alias: a second name for the same
thing buys nothing and gives you two ways to refer to one account, one of which
is always the wrong one.

The store lives inside the repository, so a `.gitignore` is the only thing
standing between a token and a public commit. That makes the ignore rule a
**precondition**, not a courtesy: before writing, this asks git whether the
store path is genuinely ignored, and refuses to write if it is not. Checking the
effective answer beats checking that a file exists, because an ignore rule can
be present and still not match.

Keys are write-only from the outside. ``list`` reports usernames and never the
key, so an agent driving this CLI can offer you a choice of accounts without the
secret ever crossing into its context. Whatever launches the runs reads the
store directly.

A fourth command, ``materialize``, exists for code rather than a human at a
terminal: it writes one worker's stored credential to a config directory,
atomically, and prints back where — never what. Nothing about it opens a
question; it is the one non-interactive way a credential this store already
holds reaches a file another process's own client can point itself at.

Usage:
    python accounts_cli.py validate                 # re-check the store, take in the inbox
    python accounts_cli.py validate <file>…         # check these instead
    python accounts_cli.py validate --interactive   # run this one yourself, in a terminal
    python accounts_cli.py remove <username>…
    python accounts_cli.py list [--json]
    python accounts_cli.py discover [--json]
    python accounts_cli.py materialize --worker <username> [--into <dir>] --json

Exit codes: 0 everything checked out, 1 at least one account failed or was
rejected (the rest are stored), 2 usage/store/environment error (nothing was
written).

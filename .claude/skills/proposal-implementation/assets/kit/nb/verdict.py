"""Turning measurements into an answer: who wins each dimension, and when nobody does.

Pure stdlib on purpose. The harness that produces the numbers needs torch; deciding
what the numbers say does not, so this can be read and tested without one.

The same table serves both settings. A synthetic sweep and a trained run over real
data measure different instruments and answer the same question — where does each
implementation hold — so they share these rules and this shape rather than each
inventing its own.

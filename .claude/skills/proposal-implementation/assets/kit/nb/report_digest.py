"""The seal that binds a report to the code that produced it.

An executed notebook says its cells ran once, not that they ran against this
code. Without a seal an old report and a freshly generated one look identical,
and the old one keeps being believed while the code moves out from under it.

This module stamps it. The notebook prints it at the end, verification
recomputes it, and if the two disagree the report is a relic.

It lives in the benchmark package because it belongs to producing the report,
not to the formulation: it implements no equation and so declares no
`__provenance__`.

**The two halves have to produce the same number.** The destination writes this
one and verification recomputes the other, so testing each against a fixture of
its own would verify both halves and never their union, which is the only thing
that matters here. The forge has a test that runs both over the same tree and
compares them.

    Modification times cannot serve here: a clone rewrites all of them with the
    checkout time and the ordering is gone. Content can.

    It covers all of `src/`, and nothing else. That boundary is the claim: a
    report depends on the code the run executes, and on nothing else.

    Naming the packages one by one failed in both directions. It left out prior
    work, which the benchmark imports — moving what an arm computes there left
    the notebooks reporting `executed` over stale numbers, and the separate
    session that goes and fixes prior work and comes back is precisely the case
    that triggers it. And it pulled in `tests/`, which no notebook imports:
    adding any test at all marked every report in the repository stale and asked
    for the campaign to be re-run to restamp a hash.

    The benchmark package stays inside, now by belonging to `src/` rather than
    by being named, and for the same reason as before: it is the module that
    renders the tables and writes the conclusions. Leaving it out allowed a
    conclusion to be corrected while the record went on asserting the old one
    with everything green.

    `package` no longer chooses what goes in. It stays in the signature because
    the two halves have to be called the same way and the destination passes it
    from `_here()`.

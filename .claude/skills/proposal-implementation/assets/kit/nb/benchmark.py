"""Bounded benchmark: train both implementations in one common setting.

This runs in the target repository, with the target's interpreter and its torch —
never the forge's. It is small, but sized rather than merely shrunk: enough to resolve
the difference worth detecting, and no larger.

Read every number together with the bounds printed beside it. Being sized for one
question does not make it an answer to every question — a setting that resolves a
three-point gap says nothing about a method whose advantage appears only at a scale
this never reached.

What speed buys is repetition. One run cannot separate a difference from its own
noise, so the default is several seeds and the report carries dispersion, never a
bare mean.

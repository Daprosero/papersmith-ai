#: The section's delimiters. Both are HTML comments — neither starts with

#: never mistake either DELIMITER for a checklist item. That claim covers
#: only these two lines. The block's own sequence items, `- [ ] N. ...`
#: (`ITEM_LINE`, below), are exactly `AGREEMENT_LINE`'s shape and WERE
#: counted as ordinary agreements — measured on a minimal fixture (2 real
#: bullets plus a 3-item block reporting `open: 5`, not 2) before this was
#: caught. The position section can sit inside a hand-curated AGREED.md
#: without inflating `agreements_state`'s counts only because
#: `implementation_cli.py`'s `_agreement_scan_text` excises the block's
#: whole byte span — start of this opener through the end of the closer —
#: before either `agreements_state` or `_agreement_collides` scans a line.
#: A claim about a delimiter is not a claim about what sits between them,

BLOCK_CLOSE = b"<!-- /position -->"

#: A loose opener, used only to COUNT how many blocks exist in the document.
#: Counting has to survive a header that is itself malformed in some other
#: way — undercounting here would let a second, broken block hide behind the
#: first one's well-formed refusal instead of raising its own.
_BLOCK_OPEN_MARKER = rb"<!--\s*position\b"

#: The one true opener: every header field, in this exact order. A match
#: whose start does not coincide with `_BLOCK_OPEN_MARKER`'s only hit means
#: the opener exists but its header does not parse — a malformed artifact,
#: not an absent one.
#:
#: `target` is new in the level-grammar revision (PR10, `the-position-
#: nobody-holds`): the ordered rung this pass is aiming at, in the target's
#: own vocabulary (see `derive`'s docstring). A block written by the prior,
#: boolean-only grammar carries no `target=` field, so its header no longer
#: matches this pattern at all — **refused, not migrated, not silently
#: reinterpreted**. That is the deliberate choice: a bare byte-shift of an
#: old block's marks onto a new tick meaning ("reached this pass's rung")
#: would be asserting a rung nobody ever measured. The refusal is the same
#: `POSITION_BLOCK_MALFORMED` class the opener already raised for any other
#: unparsable header, and `position --reconcile --target-level <level>`
#: (implementation_cli.py) is the migration path: a fresh header, sequence
#: items preserved by witness identity, ticks re-derived from scratch under
#: the new grammar.

#: The exact opener the grammar's first revision wrote, kept only so

#: The four evidence classes named by the domain — forge words, identical for

WITNESS_KINDS = frozenset({"record", "notebook", "rehearsal", "shard", "step"})

#: The `WITNESS_KINDS` a bare `--about <kind>` (implementation_cli.py's
#: `_resolve_discuss_about`) MUST NOT accept without an operand.
#:
#: Measured, not assumed: `--about notebook` with no operand built a
#: witness whose `operand` is `None`; `_agreement_collides` (whose first
#: line is `if not operand: return []`) then short-circuits to `[]` on that
#: falsy operand before it ever globs a file. The caller believes a
#: collision scan ran; nothing ran — and a fixture whose agreement text
#: does not happen to name the operand returns `[]` too, for an entirely
#: legitimate reason, so the two cases are indistinguishable without this
#: refusal.
#:
#: `record` is deliberately excluded: it names the search contract's own
#: declared record, one fact per target rather than a per-artifact operand,
#: so it is the one `WITNESS_KINDS` member legitimately operand-less — the
#: same reading `_derive_record`'s own two-state check gives it.
OPERAND_REQUIRED_KINDS = frozenset({"notebook", "rehearsal", "shard", "step"})

#: Every witness-shaped token on a line, used only to COUNT them. Exactly one
#: is required per item; a prose sentence that happens to mention another
#: backticked `@word` is exactly the false positive `BULLET_LINE` already had
#: to guard against one file over, so the count — not a bare search — is what
#: decides malformed. `(?::level)?` mirrors `WITNESS_RE`'s own optional
#: leveled marker so a marked token is still counted as exactly one.
_WITNESS_TOKEN_RE = re.compile(r"`@[a-z]+(?::level)?(?: [^`]+)?`")

#: The one true witness: backticked, anchored to end-of-line so item prose is
#: never scanned for a stray `@`. An operand may carry slashes and dots
#: (`some/dir/thing.ipynb`) without needing its own escaping, because the
#: backtick is the only character the grammar treats as a delimiter. The example
#: is deliberately not a real layout name: this module is caller-agnostic, and a
#: comment naming one of the caller's own directories teaches the next reader
#: that the core knows a layout it must always be handed.
#:
#: `:level` (PR10) is the grammar's way for a single item to opt INTO the
#: ordered ladder. **Omitted, an item is two-state** — satisfied or not, with
#: nothing in between — exactly the grammar's first revision, unchanged, so
#: every block written before PR10's ordered-level revision keeps meaning
#: exactly what it always meant once migrated onto the new header (see
#: `_BLOCK_OPEN_RE`'s docstring for why the header itself still refuses an
#: unmigrated block). Two-state is the default because that is what a
#: witness already meant before this revision; a step earns a rung by saying
#: so, explicitly, right where a reader already looks — never inferred from
#: its kind, because two targets may both write a `@notebook` witness and
#: mean different things by it (one step reads a record tied to a rung,
#: another is a local check that only ever holds or does not). The forge
#: does not decide which a kind means; the artifact declares it.

    Measured on the real holder this module's own `BLOCK_CLOSE` docstring
    already cites: `## Figures — phase 1` and `## Figures — phase 2` both
    contain `## Figures`, so a substring rule already picks the wrong one
    of two on that document alone.

    A fenced region -- a line beginning, after leading whitespace, with
    three backticks or three tildes -- toggles exclusion for every line
    between its open and its matching close. Extra hits elsewhere in the

    fenced heading as the ONLY hit is the one way a placement would land
    inside a fenced block instead of the document's own prose, so it is
    excluded here rather than merely left for the caller to notice too
    late.

    Each returned span is `{"start": p, "end": p}` -- zero-width by
    construction. A section that opens directly with a checklist item

    at all lands at the first byte of its first non-blank line, or

    list's own length by whoever asked, and only that caller names what

    **A level, not a bool (PR10) — except where an item declared itself
    two-state.** Per item, `derived` is:

    - for a two-state item (no `:level` marker, the default): `True`/`False`
      when the evidence class actually
      answers, `None` ("unmeasured") when it does not — unchanged from the
      grammar's first revision, because a two-state item has no rung to be
      assigned and never has one invented for it.
    - for a leveled item (the default): one of `evidence["levels"]`'s own
      names when the evidence resolves to a rung, `None` when it does not.
      **A leveled item is never assigned `False`; only `None` or one of the
      declared names.** `None` is never folded into the floor rung: "we did
      not look" and "it has not started" stay two different facts, the same
      rule `_record_scale` already keeps by returning `{}` rather than
      guessing.

    `unbacked` is the one asymmetry a blank box and a ticked box do not
    share. `disagrees` compares a mark against a measurement, so it is
    necessarily silent when there is no measurement — an `x` over an
    unmeasured witness contradicts nothing, because nothing was said. But
    the two marks are not equally honest there: a blank box over an
    unmeasured witness claims nothing and is exactly right to; a ticked one
    asserts a step was reached while the only thing that could confirm it
    was never looked at. Without this key those two items are byte-identical
    in every report the position produces, so the assertion nobody measured
    reads as the settled fact everybody did. `unbacked` is that, and only
    that: `satisfied is None and mark == "x"`. It is deliberately NOT folded
    into `disagrees` — a disagreement names a measurement that says
    otherwise, and there is none here to name.

    `satisfied` is the tick-worthy verdict every caller writing a mark
    should read, never `derived` directly: for a two-state item it is
    `derived` itself; for a leveled item it is whether `derived`'s rung is
    at or above `evidence["targetLevel"]` — the pass this call is deriving
    against — computed via `level_index` and `None` whenever either side is
    `None` or unknown. `disagrees` compares `satisfied` against the item's
    existing mark, not `derived`, so a two-state item and a leveled item are
    graded by the identical rule once `satisfied` exists.

    Pure: no I/O. `evidence` is a plain dict of already-computed states plus
    the declared ladder (`evidence["levels"]`, absent or `[]` for a target
    that names none) and this pass's own target (`evidence["targetLevel"]`),

    none: **the highest rung at which every leveled item grades `satisfied`.**

    A header's `target=` states what a pass AIMS at, and an aim is legitimately
    one rung above what has been reached — that is how a pass climbs at all.
    Attainment is the other fact, and until this function existed the grammar
    carried no way to say it: a reader could see the aim on every payload and
    had to trip a refusal to learn whether anything backed it. Two meanings on
    one field is how a recorded rung that outlived its evidence came to switch
    off the very rule that should have caught it.

    **Defined against `derive`, never beside it.** Each candidate rung is put
    back through `derive` with that rung as `targetLevel`, so "attained at R"
    means exactly what "satisfied at R" already means for every witness kind —
    including the ones added after this was written. The alternative, taking
    the minimum `level_index(derived)` across the items, is the same number
    today and a second arithmetic to keep in step forever.

    Three boundaries, each a decision:

    - **`None` is not the floor.** A leveled item nobody measured grades
      `satisfied is None`, which is not `True`, so it holds attainment below
      every rung — including the first. "We did not look" and "it has not
      started" stay two different facts here exactly as they do in `derive`.
    - **Two-state items never participate.** They are graded without the ladder
      and read identically at every rung, so they carry no information about
      which one was reached. Folding them in would make this whole-sequence
      completeness under another name.
    - **A sequence with no leveled item attains the whole ladder.** Vacuously,
      and deliberately: with nothing that could fail to reach a rung, every
      rung grades attained and the answer is the top one. That is what keeps a
      target whose sequence is all two-state exactly as unconstrained by rung
      arithmetic as it was before any of it existed.

    `evidence["levels"]` is the ladder, read from the same key `derive` reads
    it from, so the two can never disagree about which ladder is in play. No
    ladder (`[]`, or the key absent) means no rung name to answer with, and the
    answer is `None`.

    Pure: no I/O, and `evidence` is copied per candidate rather than mutated,
    so a caller's own `targetLevel` survives the call untouched and never
    reaches the grading — attainment is a property of the evidence, never of
    the pass that happens to be reading it.

    """Whether one `git status --porcelain` line is this skill's own ledger.

    The guard exists so the skill never mutates a repository carrying somebody
    else's uncommitted work. Its own append-only ledger is not somebody else's
    work, and counting it produced a measured deadlock: every ledger-appending
    command (`position`, `discuss`, `gate`, `close`, `step`) leaves the tree
    dirty, so the next clean-requiring command (`plan`, `apply`, `step`)
    refuses. Measured on a scratch target -- one step ran, the second returned
    `DIRTY_WORKTREE` with `M <product>/.implementation/position.jsonl` as the
    only entry, and three ran back to back once that path was excluded.

    This excuses the path, never the question of whether the ledger belongs in
    the index at all. That is a separate decision, and this guard behaves the
    same either way -- which is the point: a repository that ignores its ledger
    and one that commits it must not disagree about whether a step may run.

    Porcelain paths are repository-relative. A rename carries two of them
    (`old -> new`) and both are checked, because a half-matched rename is not
    this skill's own bookkeeping.
